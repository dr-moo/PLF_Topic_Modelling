Whilst there are many techniques to measure animal welfare, the challenge lies with how best to align these with future changes in definitions and expectations, advances in science, legislative requirements, and technology improvements. Furthermore, enforcement of current animal welfare legislation in relation to livestock in Australia and the reliance on self-audits for accreditation schemes, challenges our ability to objectively measure animal welfare. On-animal sensors have enormous potential to address animal welfare concerns and assist with legislative compliance, through continuous measurement and monitoring of an animal’s behavioural state and location being reflective of their wellbeing. As reliable animal welfare measures evolve and the cost of on-animal sensors reduce, technology adoption will increase as the benefits across the supply chain are realised. Future adoption of on-animal sensors by producers will primarily depend on a value proposition for their business being clear; algorithm development to ensure measures are valid and reliable; increases in producer knowledge, willingness, and trust in data governance; and improvements in data transmission and connectivity. © 2021 by the authors.

So far, this has helped us make significant gains in animal husbandry and farming. Together the growing demand for food and the advancement in sensing technology have the potential to make animal farming more centralized, large scale and efficient. It has the potential to change animal farming as we know it. At a broader level, this paper explores the challenges and opportunities that sensor technologies present in terms of helping animal farmers produce more meat and animal products. More specifically, this paper explores the role of sensors, big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning in helping animal farmers to lower production costs, increase efficiencies, enhance animal welfare and grow more animals per hectare. It also explores the challenges and limitations of technology. The paper reviews various animal farming technology applications to understand its value in helping farmers improve animal health, increase profits and lower environmental footprint. © 2020 The Author","Animal health; Precision livestock farming; Sensor systems; Smart farming; Well-being",

One way to give an added value to this stored data is to extract useful knowledge from it, for the ending-system or the end-users by a process commonly called knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD). Smart Farming uses a large amount of connected technologies producing also a huge amount of data in order to maximize productions by reducing: human efforts, environment impact and wasting natural resources. In this paper, We develop a new data analytic architecture dedicated to Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) to improve in particular the livestock animals production, animals' welfare, and farming processes. We present a new data processing architecture for a knowledge-base management system (KBMS) allowing to ease decision support and monitoring operations that can help farmers and stakeholders to better exploit data and have a long-term view of the evolution of the knowledge it contains. Our main contribution in the present paper is a new architecture specifically developed for the precision livestock farming integrating a periodical data reevaluation which address the problematic of data conservation and the decrease in data value over time. © 2020 The Authors.

Literature gives insufficient anchor points to estimate the value of information (VOI) obtained with PLF technologies. This study proposes a conceptual framework with building blocks to determine the VOI. Next, the framework is used to describe factors and existing gaps in the VOI assessment. This, finally, leads to reflections and recommendations about how to assess and improve the VOI of PLF. Literature reveals that the VOI surpasses the mere use of more precise information to take decisions, but encompasses a path from data collection to decisions with particular outcomes. The framework interlinks three building blocks: (i) data processing, (ii) decision making and (iii) impact analysis with factors influencing the VOI such as the process to transform data into information, level of precision, decision rules, social influences, the accuracy of information, herd size and prevalence of the condition measured. Besides profitability, outcomes from decisions include the impact on animal welfare, environment, food safety, and food security. The data-to-value framework allows for a better assessment of VOI and its potentials, and provides anchor points to design useful and valuable PLF technologies. The framework also helps to determine the role of advisors in interpreting the more precise information and in formulating farmer-tailored advice to apply the most optimal practices. Both technology design and advisors’ role may enhance the VOI of future PLF developments and applications. © 2019","Conceptual framework; Economic analysis; Precision livestock farming; Role of advisors; Value of information","accuracy assessment; assessment method; conceptual framework; data processing; detection method; economic analysis; livestock; livestock farming; technological development; Animalia"

The natural consequence of this is to drive the farmer and the animal further apart. However, closer attention to the animal not only positively impacts animal welfare and health but can also increase the capacity of the farmer to achieve a more sustainable production. State-of-the-art precision livestock farming (PLF) technology is one such means of bringing the animals closer to the farmer in the facing of expanding systems. Contrary to some current opinions, it can offer an alternative philosophy to 'farming by numbers'. This review addresses the key technology-oriented approaches to monitor animals and demonstrates how image and sound analyses can be used to build 'digital representations' of animals by giving an overview of some of the core concepts of PLF tool development and value discovery during PLF implementation. The key to developing such a representation is by measuring important behaviours and events in the livestock buildings. The application of image and sound can realise more advanced applications and has enormous potential in the industry. In the end, the importance lies in the accuracy of the developed PLF applications in the commercial farming system as this will also make the farmer embrace the technological development and ensure progress within the PLF field in favour of the livestock animals and their well-being. © The Animal Consortium 2019.","image analysis; livestock production; sound analysis; technology","agricultural land; agricultural worker; animal; animal husbandry; animal welfare; economics; human; livestock; organization and management; procedures; Animal Husbandry; Animal Welfare; Animals; Farmers; Farms; Humans; Livestock"

Agriculture will have to increase its output to meet demand, opening the door to increased automation and technological innovation; intensified, sustainable farming; and precision livestock farming (PLF) applications. Early indicators of medical problems, which use sensors to alert cattle farmers early concerning individual animals that need special care, are proliferating. Wearable technologies dominate the market. In less-value-per-animal systems like sheep, goat, pig, poultry, and fish, one sensor, like a camera or robot per herd/flock/school, rather than one sensor per animal, will become common. PLF sensors generate huge amounts of data, and many actors benefit from PLF data. No standards currently exist for sharing sensor-generated data, limiting the use of commercial sensors. Technologies providing accurate data can enhance a well-managed farm. Development of methods to turn the data into actionable solutions is critical. Copyright © 2019 by Annual Reviews.

Extensive systems have significant and challenging welfare risks, very different from intensive systems. Predation, weather, food and water deprivation, internal and external parasites can all impact on these systems, with the animals very self-dependent. Inspection opportunities are very different. Welfare codes and supporting legal obligations are adapted to extensive and difficult environments and often have vague recommendations for inspection frequency. There are clear opportunities for PLF technologies, notably wearables, to provide more information to stockpeople, improving welfare and reducing risk. Communications from animal to stockpeople via GSM or LPWAN enables real-time monitoring (RTM) for illness, such as lameness (with IMU), for mis-mothering (with proximity), for straying away from preferred areas and/or into dangerous areas (with location technology such as GNSS), for predation/worrying from wild animals/domestic dogs (with GNSS and/or IMU). These can signify need for action or assurance for no action. However, wearables have welfare risks. Research-user experiences confirm direct welfare risks through physical damage from equipment. With infrequent inspection, small issues can become larger. There are additional animal energy demands of heavier wearables. The conservation science community note impacts of wearables for survival and reproductive success. Good design and low weight are critical issues for commercialisation. False-positive alerts and reports could involve considerable wasted time by stockpeople and new value judgements may be needed. Without RTM-based PLF, the animal could face welfare challenges or be in a poor welfare state, about which the stockperson has no knowledge, and with infrequent inspections, this state may continue or worsen. With RTM based PLF, then the stockperson should know and logically has a changed duty of care and responsibility to act upon this information. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The animal welfare can be measured with indicators capable of expressing the animals' adaptability to the environment. Temperature is one of the main components of the environment, since it influences the physiology, behaviour and productivity of the pigs. The first phase of this study aims to verify the adaptive evolution to different environmental conditions (summer, thermoneutrality and winter) in growing and fattening pigs. Seven females (initial weight: 45 kg) were used. The animals were housed in a room equipped with an environmental control system. The environmental data collected were temperature and relative humidity. The physiological parameters measured were surface and rectal temperature. The feed intake was monitored through an individual feed machine. In order to monitor the behaviour of animals, video cameras and microphones were installed. The final weight of the animals was about 95 kg. Respectively in summer, thermoneutrality and winter, the daily food intake was 2.111 kg day-1; 2.473 kg day-1; 2.814 kg day-1 and the average daily gain was 0.768 kg day-1; 0.923 kg day-1; 0.808 kg day-1. The corresponding values of surface temperature were 36.2 ºC; 33.6 ºC and 35.2 ºC and of body temperature were 38.9 ºC, 38.7 ºC and 38.4 ºC. In order to validate the methodology and some results, the second phase of the project will be in a commercial farm, where the animals are submitted to real conditions. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Based on the tradition of pragmatism in applied philosophy I develop a Moral Operating System of animal production systems in cooperating a plurality of ethical views. This moral operating system of animal production systems consists of two interactive, dynamic parts: an internal professional care ethics combined with an emergent ethics in life sciences enabling change by responsible innovation, and external ethical boundary conditions based on societal values and concerns in animal ethics and environmental ethics. I focus on the emergent ethics in life sciences because it most normative ethical theories have problems in dealing with the future. In moral reasoning about innovations in the making, the relevant moral facts and the appropriate principles are more or less still unknown, as also the relevant moral consequences. Only by doing ethics in life sciences in future projects will the moral dilemmas emerge in the trajectories of responsible innovation like molecular technologies in animal sciences and precision livestock farming. © 2017, Central European Pragmatist Forum.",,

Moreover, innovations of a profoundly impactful nature on someone’s daily work processes, such as precision dairy farming, are never adopted solely on financial grounds. For a farmer, new technologies should also adhere to beliefs and perceptions of, for instance, usefulness, reliability, attractiveness, or effect on wellbeing. These factors –together with many others-constitute the so-called ‘user experience’. This is a matter of design, and is closely connected to the most important component of the business model: the value proposition. For creators of precision farming applications, for instance, it is crucial to design in such a way that farmer adoption is most likely, because it is being valued by them. In a current project on precision dairy farming (PDF), research on user experience and the optimal value proposition for PDF applications, has resulted in two guiding tools for PDF application developers: storyboards and user experience design principles. The storyboards show how an app becomes of value in the daily life of different types of farmers, whereas the design principles are a basis for the IT development of an app. In designing applications for dairy farming practices these tools are proposed to be used as a basis. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

It affects the nature and frequency of their daily tasks, specifically in relation to animals, and the data available about the animals. Consequently, it may affect the quality of the human-animal relationship and how farmers perceive their profession. To better understand these effects, a survey was carried out on 25 French farms raising three different species and equipped with different tools: milking robots and heat detectors for dairy cows, automatic feeders for sows, and electronic controllers and automatic weighing devices for poultry. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the farmers. The main results showed that there were diverse motivations behind the farmers’ decision to install new equipment: some sought better working conditions, others to improve their technical management, yet others were induced by value chain incentives. Most mentioned that their job had become more technical, and the majority were satisfied. Farmers’ interactions with their animals had changed and sometimes decreased, with less time spent in their presence or in direct contact. Digital data enabled a different view of animals, focusing on problematic individuals. Some farmers continued to observe their animals and used specific practices to facilitate work and reduce animal stress, while others delegated decisions and tasks entirely to their equipment. Nevertheless, some farmers noted limits regarding the place of new technologies on a farm, such as the risk of losing their own autonomy or their ability to observe animals and detect problems. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Innovative business models for these service organisations can be based upon inter-company data exchange. The adoption of data-driven innovations often requires upfront investments. Furthermore, beyond financial means, it also requires change within organisations, for example, because employees need to be trained on the innovation. This can make the adoption of an innovation difficult. The required changes can be regarded as either barriers or accelerators; barriers might form bottlenecks in further adoption of an innovation, whereas accelerators help to stimulate adoption. It is therefore pivotal to gain insight into the barriers and accelerators in the organisational adoption process. Several workshops with different stakeholders of the dairy farming value chain were held to identify barriers and accelerators for the adoption of a technology that facilitates sharing and combining dairy farming related data (the InfoBroker). Different barriers and accelerators were uncovered. An important accelerator is the expectation to gain a competitive advantage with data-based models. An important barrier is that there are a lot of perceived insecurities in the process to come to data driven services. The factors were plotted on an existing model for innovation adoption. The model was then extended on the basis of the findings in the workshops. The identified barriers and accelerators can be translated into measures to, on the one hand, overcome those barriers and, on the other hand, utilise the accelerators. Examples are: providing decision makers and users of the innovation with the most relevant and persuasive information, and establishing precise requirements for employee training. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

For sensor manufacturers, it is important to realize that uncertainty about future technological progress may influence the adoption of sensors. The aim of the current study was to explain why dairy farmers do not (yet) adopt sensors on their farms. To explain this, the uncertainty of the investment decision for highly adopted sensors (automated estrus detection) and recently released and thus hardly adopted sensors (automated body condition scoring (BCS)) was illustrated. The illustration makes use of the real options theory to analyze the timing of investment decisions. The results indicated that investing now in automated estrus detection resulted in higher economic returns than investing 5 years from now, while for the automated BCS postponing the investment resulted in higher economic returns compared to investing now. These results show that farmers indicating that they did not (yet) invest in sensors because they are waiting for improved versions made rational decisions. Based on the illustration it is economically worthwhile to postpone investments in sensors for which there is much uncertainty. Also, the current high adoption of automated estrus detection sensors is logical because the net present value of investing now is higher than the net present value of investing in 5 years. This study illustrated that uncertainty about the benefits of a sensor system, potential future improvement of sensor technology, and expected better management information from a sensor system, form rational economic reasons to postpone investment in sensor systems. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

The farmer walks among the birds daily, but has in comparison with other livestock little physical contact with individual animals. Even with this limited contact, studies show that qualitative aspects of the relationship between the caretaker and the poultry flock can affect both the animals' welfare and the productivity. In this pilot study, the possibility to assess human-animal relationship in a broiler flock using the techniques of precision livestock farming was investigated. Automatic tracking of the activity level of the flock was compared to the human-animal relationship as assessed by a human observer. Two small groups of broilers (Ross 308) were reared for 36 days. One of the groups was treated with additional human contact every day to make the birds more familiar to humans. Welfare assessment according to the Welfare Quality® protocol for poultry (2009) was carried out once a week, with special emphasis on human-animal relationship using the Avoidance Distance Test (ADT). Video recording of the birds' response to the presence of a human was carried out once a week in both groups. The recordings started when a human began walking through the flock. Analysis of the activity of the birds after the human had left the pen was carried out using image analysis software. Activity was for each second expressed as an index between 0 and 1. Results show that the additional human contact group had different values on the ADT-test than the control group: 91 % of total number of birds could be touched compared to 65 %. At week 5 the activity level after a human had left the pen, was lower for the additional human contact group than for the control group (average index level 0.06 compared to 0.09). The results from this pilot study show a potential of using automatic recording of activity of broiler to assess the human-animal relationship but this needs further development.","Activity; Automatic recording; Broiler; Human-animal relationship","Agriculture; Thermodynamic properties; Video recording; Automatic recording; Automatic tracking; Broiler; Broiler productions; Human-animal relationship; Image analysis software; Precision livestock farming; Qualitative aspects; Birds"
