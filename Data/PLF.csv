One of the most important steps for this purpose is to study the feasibility of using acoustic features as criteria for disease diagnosis. In this research five acoustic features of bird calls were evaluated for determination of bird health condition. Signals were collected from broilers grown in three groups: control, challenged with Bronchitis, and challenged with Newcastle disease. Results of data analysis showed that, among the 5 acoustic features studied, wavelet entropy (WET) had the best performance and was able to detect Bronchitis on the third day after inoculation with 83% accuracy while the type II error in this test (incorrectly detecting sick bird as healthy) was less than 14% and 6% on the third day and fourth day, respectively. In the case of Newcastle disease, although WET and Mel cepstral coefficients (MFCC) exhibited similar accuracy (80% and 78% respectively on the fourth day), but the difference was that WET was more reliable in detecting healthy birds while MFCC had better performance detecting challenged birds. © 2020","Audio features; Bioacoustics; Health monitoring; Precision livestock farming; Respiratory diseases","Agriculture; Birds; Diagnosis; Disease control; Acoustic features; Cepstral coefficients; Disease diagnosis; Health condition; Health monitoring; Precision livestock farming; Type II error; Wavelet entropies; Bioacoustics"

In dairy farming, particular attention is paid to the automatic cow detection and tracking, as such information is closely related to animal welfare and thus to possible health issues. Computer vision represents a suitable and promising method for this purpose. This paper describes the first step for the development of a computer vision system, based on deep learning, aiming to recognize in real-time the individual cows, detect their positions, actions and movements and record the time history outputs for each animal. Specifically, a neural network based on deep learning techniques has been trained and validated on a case study farm, for the automatic recognition of individual cows in videos recorded in the barn. Four cows were selected to train and validate a YOLO neural network able to recognize a cow starting from the coat pattern. Then, precision-recall curves of the identification of individual cows were elaborated for both the specific target classes and the whole dataset in order to assess the performances of the network. By means of data augmentation techniques, an enlarged dataset has been created and considered in order to improve the performance of the network and to provide indications to increase detection efficiency in those cases where data acquisition is not easy to be carried out for long periods. The mean average precision of the detection, ranging from 0.64 to 0.66, showed that it is possible to properly identify individual cows based on their morphological appearance and that the piebald spotting pattern of a cow's coat represents a clearly distinguishable object for a computer vision network. The results also led to obtain indications about the quantity and the characteristics of the images to be used for the network training in order to achieve efficient detections when facing with applications involving animals. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Computer vision; Dairy cow; Deep learning; Herd management; Precision livestock farming","Animals; Computer vision; Data acquisition; Farm buildings; Learning systems; Neural networks; Automatic recognition; Computer vision system; Detection and tracking; Detection efficiency; Efficient detection; Identification of individuals; Learning techniques; Precision livestock farming; Deep learning"

In modern breeding barns, the population of animals generally supports a female:male ratio of 10:1, wherein males and females each receive their own food supply. To control this supply the broiler breeders are weighed using automatic electronic platform weighers and the weights are then classified into cockerel and hen categories using theoretical growth curves. However, due to the non-uniform growth of the animals and replacement (called spiking) of cockerals this classification is not always correct, causing a risk of under/over feeding of the population. To overcome this challenge, in this study we have developed a system that integrates the electronic platform weigher with the low-cost 3D Kinect camera was employed to separate weigh male and female broiler breeders under commercial conditions. A novel image processing algorithm is proposed. The algorithm first constructed the Height Accumulating Image (HAI) using depth image to locate the region of interest (ROI) where a broiler breeder jumps onto the weigher, then the comb size was calculated on RGB image as the gender classifying feature, and finally, an adaptive classification threshold was determined by the kernel density estimation using the recent days comb size measurements. The results showed that enough measurements can be obtained for estimating overall weight expectation with the average acceptance rate of 77.32%. Based on these accepted measurements, the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and specificity were 99.7%, 98.82%, 100% and 100% respectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Broiler breeder; Image processing; Precision Livestock Farming; Weighing","Animals; Cameras; Costs; Food supply; Image segmentation; Population statistics; Adaptive classification; Camera technology; Control variable; Electronic platforms; Image processing algorithm; Kernel Density Estimation; Size measurements; The region of interest (ROI); Quality control; Gallus gallus"

Sensor technologies can automatically detect variations in daily activity, but it remains difficult to detect exactly when the circadian rhythm disruption starts. Here we report a mathematical Fourier-Based Approximation with Thresholding (FBAT) method designed to detect changes in the circadian activity rhythm of cows whatever the cause of change (typically disease, stress, oestrus). We used data from an indoor positioning system that provides the time per hour spent by each cow resting, in alleys, or eating. We calculated the hourly activity level of each cow by attributing a weight to each activity. We considered 36-h time series and used Fourier transform to model the variations in activity during the first and last 24 h of these 36-h series. We then compared the Euclidian distance between the two models against a given threshold above which we considered that rhythm had changed. We tested the method on four datasets (giving a cumulative total of ~120000 cow*days) that included disease episodes (acidosis, lameness, mastitis or other infectious diseases), reproductive events (oestrus or calving) and external stimuli that can stress animals (e.g. relocation). The method obtained over 80% recall of normal days and detected 95% of abnormal rhythms due to health or reproductive events. FBAT could be implemented in precision livestock farming system monitoring tools to alert caretakers to individual animals needing specific care. The FBAT method also has the potential to detect anomalies in humans to guide healthcare intervention or in wild animals to detect disturbances. We anticipate that chronobiological studies could apply FBAT to help relate circadian rhythm anomalies to specific events. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Chronobiology; Disease; Fourier transform; Oestrus; Precision Livestock Farming; Stress",

The subsequent challenges of maintaining the quality of both routine management and environmental comfort of pigs to minimize the loss of both pigs’ health and welfare can be attained by implementing autonomous monitoring and intelligent management deci-sions based on precision livestock farming (PLF). A three‐layer wireless sensor network (WSN) based on ZigBee technology has been devised to monitor four environmental parameters in real-time, namely: temperature, relative humidity, concentrations of carbon dioxide and ammonia in a commercial gestating sow house. The overall packet loss rate of the WSN system which reported 16,371 records from its 41 indoor slave nodes in a 10‐min interval for three consecutive days was 4%. The carbon dioxide sensors had an average outlier rate of 6.5% after a series of preprocessing procedures. The spatial and temporal characteristics showed that the carbon dioxide level exceeded the limit of 2700 mg/m3 twice during both 07:00–08:00 and 14:00–15:00. Besides, the overall NH3 concentration in the swine building was maintained in a relatively low‐level range with a maximum of less than 8 mg/m3. In sum, the real‐time monitoring and timely intervention of microclimate in this commercial gestating sow house can be achieved by deploying this WSN system, thereby making it possible to provide an intelligent decision on precise management of livestock automatically. © 2021 by the authors.

AMS have the potential to increase the effectiveness of the milking process and sustain animal welfare. This study assessed the state of the art of research activities on AMS through a systematic review of scientific and industrial research. The papers and patents of the last 20 years (2000–2019) were analysed to assess the research tendencies. The words appearing in title, abstract and keywords of a total of 802 documents were processed with the text mining tool. Four clusters were identified (Components, Technology, Process and Animal). For each cluster, the words frequency analysis enabled us to identify the research tendencies and gaps. The results showed that focuses of the scientific and industrial research areas complementary, with scientific papers mainly dealing with topics related to animal and process, and patents giving priority to technology and components. Both scientific and industrial research converged on some crucial objectives, such as animal welfare, process sustainability and technological development. Despite the increasing inter-est in animal welfare, this review highlighted that further progress is needed to meet the consumers’ demand. Moreover, milk yield is still regarded as more valuable compared to milk quality. There-fore, additional effort is necessary on the latter. At the process level, some gaps have been found related to cleaning operations, necessary to improve milk quality and animal health. The use of farm data and their incorporation on herd decision support systems (DSS) appeared optimal. The results presented in this review may be used as an overall assessment useful to address future research. © 2021 by the authors.

At the same time, Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) technologies, which allow for automated animal monitoring are entering commercial pig farms. With their claim of improving animal health and welfare, these innovations may respond to public concerns. However, they may raise problems of societal acceptance themselves. In this review, we investigate whether the available literature allows for an analysis to which extent PLF can mitigate or reinforce societal concerns related to pig production. We first analyze papers on pig husbandry systems in general, and then those on PLF as an innovation in animal production. In general, there is a tension between citizens and farmers. Citizens hold rather negative attitudes whereas farmers evaluate pig production more positively. Literature on attitudes of other actors, such as veterinarians, is missing. Information on the attitudes toward PLF of stakeholders other than farmers is lacking. Possible challenges of societal acceptance of PLF and chances to overcome these are only discussed in theoretical approaches. We conclude that to analyze the role of PLF in addressing societal concerns over pig production, there is a need for further empirical research including attention to underlying values of all stakeholders. This should focus on the attitudes of the currently missing stakeholders toward pig husbandry in general, and on those of the wider society toward PLF. Only by means of additional data, it will be possible to evaluate whether PLF has the potential to address societal concerns related to pig production. © Copyright © 2021 Giersberg and Meijboom.","attitude; perception; pig production; precision livestock farming; society","agricultural worker; animal experiment; attention; attitude; empirical research; Europe; livestock; nonhuman; perception; pig; review; social acceptance; tension; veterinarian"

Currently there are no ‘benchmarks’ or any scientific assessments available for measuring and quantifying the emotional responses of farm animals. Using sensors to collect biometric data as a means of measuring animal emotions is a topic of growing interest in agricultural technology. Here we reviewed several aspects of the use of sensor-based approaches in monitoring animal emotions, beginning with an introduction on animal emotions. Then we reviewed some of the available tech-nological systems for analyzing animal emotions. These systems include a variety of sensors, the algorithms used to process biometric data taken from these sensors, facial expression, and sound analysis. We conclude that a single emotional expression measurement based on either the facial feature of animals or the physiological functions cannot show accurately the farm animal’s emotional changes, and hence compound expression recognition measurement is required. We propose some novel ways to combine sensor technologies through sensor fusion into efficient systems for monitoring and measuring the animals’ compound expression of emotions. Finally, we explore future perspectives in the field, including challenges and opportunities. © 2020 by the authors.

They are frequently integrated with other new technologies in order to improve human–livestock interactions, productivity and economical sustainability of modern farms. New systems are constantly being developed for concentrated farming operations as well as for extensive and pasture-based farming systems. The development of technologies for grazing animals is of particular interest for the Mediterranean extensive sheep farming sector. Dairy sheep farming is a typical production system of the area linked to its historical and cultural traditions. The area provides roughly 40% of the world sheep milk, having 27% of the milk-producing ewes. Developed countries of the area (France, Italy, Greece and Spain – FIGS) have highly specialized production systems improved through animal selection, feeding techniques and intensification of production. However, extensive systems are still practiced alongside intensive ones due to their lower input costs and better resilience to market fluctuations. In the current article, we evaluate possible PLF systems and their suitability to be incorporated in extensive dairy sheep farming as practiced in the FIGS countries. Available products include: electronic identification systems (now mandatory in the EU) such as ear tags, ruminal boluses and sub-cutaneous radio-frequency identification; on-animal sensors such as accelerometers, global positioning systems and social activity loggers; and stationary management systems such as walk-over-weights, automatic drafter (AD), virtual fencing and milking parlour-related technologies. The systems were considered according to their suitability for the management and business model common in dairy sheep farming. However, adoption of new technologies does not take place immediately in small and medium scale extensive farming. As sheep farmers usually belong to more conservative technology consumers, characterized by an average age of 60 and a very transparent community, the dynamics do not favour financial risk taking involved with new technologies. Financial barriers linked to production volumes and resource management of extensive farming are also a barrier for innovation. However, future prospectives could increase the importance of technology and promote its wider adoption. Trends such as global sheep milk economics, global warming, awareness to animal welfare, antibiotics resistance and European agricultural policies could influence the farming practices and stimulate wider adoption of PLF systems in the near future. © 2020 The Authors","Extensive farming; Farmer's acceptance; New technologies; Precision livestock farming; Sheep",

However, especially when considering very large animal farms, the precise and up-to-date information about the position and numbers of the animals is rather difficult to obtain. In this contribution, a novel engineering approach to livestock positioning and counting, based on image processing, is proposed. The approach is composed of two parts. Namely, a fully convolutional neural network for input image transformation, and a locator for animal positioning. The transformation process is designed in order to transform the original RGB image into a gray-scale image, where animal positions are highlighted as gradient circles. The locator then detects the positions of the circles in order to provide the positions of animals. The presented approach provides a precision rate of 0.9842 and a recall rate of 0.9911 with the testing set, which is, in combination with a rather suitable computational complexity, a good premise for the future implementation under real conditions. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fully convolutional neural network; Livestock counting; Precision agriculture; U-Net","Agriculture; Animals; Convolutional neural networks; Soft computing; Gray-scale images; Input image; Livestock farming; Precision rates; Recall rate; RGB images; Transformation process; Image segmentation"

In particular, the use of on-site dairy farm instruments to detect calving is a tool in reproduction livestock farming. The primary aim of this study was to validate the ability of the Moocall device (MD) to detect calving cows. In addition, behavioural changes in parturient dairy cows were evaluated using video-based observations. The MD was applied approximately 9 days before cow delivery. Observational sessions were conducted three times a day for each cow from the day before MD application to calving time. The sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) at 3 and 24 h before calving were measured to test the effectiveness of the MD. In addition, behavioural changes were investigated before and after the MD application as well as before and during calving time. The 3 h Se and the 3 h Sp obtained were 95.2 and 71.4%, respectively. No false negatives were observed in the 24 h before delivery (24 h Se = 100%) while the 3 h Se was 95.2%. The MD was well tolerated by the dairy cows since no change in behaviours was observed in this study among the cows with or without the MD, except for an increase in eating behaviour in the animals with the MD. As regards, the behavioural pattern during calving time (8 h before calving) in comparison with the previous phases, a significant increase in tail contraction frequency and raised tail position, and a decrease in eating behaviour and rumination time were observed. The first principal component (PC) was primarily explained by these variables, and calving cows best contributed to this PC. According to the results of the present study, the use of the MD can be a useful tool in detecting the moment of calving. © 2020 The Authors","Automatic tail movement detection; Calving time; Dairy cattle; Precision livestock farming; Welfare",

The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article, authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture. The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent.

Whilst there are many techniques to measure animal welfare, the challenge lies with how best to align these with future changes in definitions and expectations, advances in science, legislative requirements, and technology improvements. Furthermore, enforcement of current animal welfare legislation in relation to livestock in Australia and the reliance on self-audits for accreditation schemes, challenges our ability to objectively measure animal welfare. On-animal sensors have enormous potential to address animal welfare concerns and assist with legislative compliance, through continuous measurement and monitoring of an animal’s behavioural state and location being reflective of their wellbeing. As reliable animal welfare measures evolve and the cost of on-animal sensors reduce, technology adoption will increase as the benefits across the supply chain are realised. Future adoption of on-animal sensors by producers will primarily depend on a value proposition for their business being clear; algorithm development to ensure measures are valid and reliable; increases in producer knowledge, willingness, and trust in data governance; and improvements in data transmission and connectivity. © 2021 by the authors.

There is evidence to suggest that monitoring change in a single behaviour might not be enough for disease prediction. In calves, multiple behaviours such as locomo-tor play, self-grooming, feeding and activity whilst lying are likely to be informative. However, these behaviours can occur rarely in the real world, which means simply counting behaviours based on the prediction of a classifier can lead to overestimation. Here, we equipped thirteen pre-weaned dairy calves with collar-mounted sensors and monitored their behaviour with video cameras. Behavioural observations were recorded and merged with sensor signals. Features were calculated for 1–10-s windows and an AdaBoost ensemble learning algorithm implemented to classify behaviours. Finally, we developed an adjusted count quantification algorithm to predict the prevalence of locomotor play behaviour on a test dataset with low true prevalence (0.27%). Our algorithm identified locomotor play (99.73% accuracy), self-grooming (98.18% accuracy), ruminating (94.47% accuracy), non-nutritive suckling (94.96% accuracy), nutritive suckling (96.44% accuracy), active lying (90.38% accuracy) and non-active lying (90.38% accuracy). Our results detail recommended sampling frequencies, feature selection and window size. The quantification estimates of locomotor play behaviour were highly correlated with the true prevalence (0.97; p < 0.001) with a total overestimation of 18.97%.

A key issue is how to assess the effect of perturbations and provide metrics to quantify how animals cope with their environment. Milk production dynamics is good candidates to address this issue: i) they are easily accessible, ii) overall dynamics throughout lactation process are well described and iii) perturbations are visible through milk losses. In this study, a perturbed lactation model (PLM) with explicit representation of perturbations was developed. The model combines two components: i) the unperturbed lactation model that describes a theoretical lactation curve, assumed to reflect female production potential and ii) the perturbation model that describes all the deviations from the unperturbed lactation model with four parameters: starting date, intensity and shape (collapse and recovery). To illustrate the use of the PLM as a phenotyping tool, it was fitted on a data set of 319 complete lactations from 181 individual dairy goats. A total of 2 354 perturbations were detected, with an average of 7.40 perturbations per lactation. Loss of milk production for the whole lactation due to perturbations varied between 2 and 19% of the milk production predicted by the unperturbed lactation model. The number of perturbations was not the major factor explaining the loss of milk production, suggesting that there are different types of animal response to challenges. By incorporating explicit representation of perturbations in a lactation model, it was possible to determine for each female the potential milk production, characteristics of each perturbation and milk losses induced by perturbations. Further, it was possible to compare animals and analyze individual variability. The indicators produced by the PLM are likely to be useful to move from raw data to decision support tools in dairy production. © 2020","Disturbances; Individual variability; Milk yield; Precision phenotyping; Resilience",

As KBD may be linked with chronic pain and a decrease in mobility, it is a serious welfare problem. An automatic assessment system at the slaughter line could support the detection of KBD and would have the advantage of being standardized and fast scoring including high sample sizes. A 2MP stereo camera combined with an IDS imaging color camera was used for the automatic assessment. A trained human assessor visually scored KBD in defeathered hens during the slaughter process and compared results with further human assessors and automatic recording. In a first step, an algorithm was developed on the basis of assessments of keel status of 2287 hens of different genetics with varying degrees of KBD. In two optimization steps, performance data were calculated, and flock prevalences were determined, which were compared between the assessor and the automatic system. The proposed technique finally reached a sensitivity of 0.95, specificity of 0.77, accuracy of 0.86 and precision of 0.81. In the last optimization step, the automatic system scored on average about 10.5% points lower KBD prevalences than the human assessor. However, a proposed change of scoring system (setting the limit for KBD at 0.5 cm deviation from the straight line) would lower this deviation. We conclude that the developed automatic scoring technique is a reliable and potentially valuable tool for the assessment of KBD. © 2021 by the authors.

The aims of this study were 1) to describe the pattern of reticulo-rumen temperature and activity variation in nulliparous Gyr heifers close to calving, and 2) to evaluate the predictive potential of these traits for calving in Gyr heifers. Forty pregnant Gyr heifers that had calved between August and December 2017 at the Getúlio Vargas Experimental Station, Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecuária de Minas Gerais (Epamig), Brazil, were used. The animals received a rumen bolus to monitor reticulo-rumen temperature (Trr) and activity (Act) at intervals of 10 min. Mixed linear models were used. A decrease in Trr and an increase in Act were observed on the days preceding calving. Differences in Trr and Act were more evident during the final 21 and 11 h previous to calving compared to 14 days before calving, measured at the same time of day. There was a decrease of about 0.20 °C in Trr at the time of calving when compared to baseline (14 days before calving measured at the same time of day). Environmental variables, such as temperature and air humidity, as well as biological factors such as circadian rhythm, may influence the interpretation of the data. In conclusion, variations exist in the Trr and Act of Gyr heifers in the hours before calving, which is preceded by a decrease in Trr and an increase in Act. Particularities in the thermal physiology of Zebu cattle must be considered when prediction devices previously validated only for European breeds are used. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Dairy cattle farming; Precision livestock farming; Reproductive management; Thermal physiology; Zebu cattle","adult; agricultural worker; animal experiment; article; breed; circadian rhythm; dairy cattle; female; heifer; human; humidity; Minas Gerais; nonhuman; nullipara; prediction; pregnancy; rumen; zebu"

However, current cooling systems often work at a constant schedule based on the ambient temperature and not on monitoring the animal itself. This study hypothesized that tailoring the cooling management to the cow's thermal reaction can mitigate heat stress. We propose a dynamic cooling system based on in vivo temperature sensors (boluses). Thus, cooling can be activated as needed and is thus most efficacious. A total of 30 lactating cows were randomly assigned to one of two groups; the groups received two different evaporative cooling regimes. A control group received cooling sessions on a preset time-based schedule, the method commonly used in farms; and an experimental group, which received the sensor-based (SB) cooling regime. Sensor-based was changed weekly according to the cow's reaction, as reflected in the changes in body temperatures from the previous week, as measured by reticulorumen boluses. The two treatment groups of cows had similar milk yields (44.7 kg/d), but those in the experimental group had higher milk fat (3.65 vs 3.43%), higher milk protein (3.23 vs 3.13%), higher energy corrected milk (ECM, 42.84 vs 41.48 kg/d), higher fat corrected milk 4%; (42.76 vs 41.34 kg/d), and shorter heat stress duration (5.03 vs 9.46 h/day) comparing to the control. Dry matter intake was higher in the experimental group. Daily visits to the feed trough were less frequent, with each visit lasting longer. The sensor-based cooling regime may be an effective tool to detect and ease heat stress in high-producing dairy cows during transitional seasons when heat load can become severe in arid and semi-arid zones. © 2020","Body temperature; Bolus; Global warming; Precision livestock farming; Sensor",

Advancements in accessible technology and computational methods offer new applications for precision livestock farming, such as monitoring internal movements to better understand biosecurity compliance on farm. In this study, a beacon-sensor based internal movement system (PigChamp Pro Europa®) was utilized to investigate the association between weekly within-farm movements of workers and an important production parameter: average weekly number of pigs weaned per sow (PWS), on three US swine farms. Sensors were installed in each room of each farm and Bluetooth-based beacons were distributed individually to farm employees. Movement data was collected for approximately one year and production data was extracted from each farm retrospectively. A linear mixed effects model was fit in STATA 15 with the primary outcome as the average weekly number of pigs weaned per sow and farm included as a random effect. The main predictors included the weekly frequency of three movement types thought to be risky with respect to disease transmission and maintenance in the herd. The frequency values of the three movements were categorized based on the tertile values for each farm. The movement with the highest average frequency was between farrowing rooms for all three farms. The medium frequency of movements category between farrowing rooms the two-weeks preceding the outcome was significantly associated with a decrease in PWS by nearly 1-pig for every 5-sows after controlling for farm, pre-weaning mortality, PWS the week prior, and season (p = 0.03). The random effect variance estimate for the model was 0.21 with a standard error of 0.18. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.67 with a standard error of 0.19, indicating that 67% of the unexplained variability in PWS could be attributed to the farm level. This study demonstrates the application of beacon-sensor technology to monitor internal personnel movements in swine production. Technological applications to monitoring trends of within farm movements of farm personnel, such as the system used here, may have the potential to identify specific movements related to farm-specific biosecurity protocol allowing corrective measures and facilitating focused efforts on disease control and mitigation; in turn maintaining productivity and improving overall animal health. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Beacon-sensing technology; Internal biosecurity; Swine; Swine production; Withinfarm movements","agricultural land; agricultural worker; animal health; Article; autumn; data extraction; disease control; disease transmission; herd; human; mortality; nonhuman; outcome assessment; pig farming; priority journal; sow (swine); spring; summer; trend study; United States; weaning; winter"

Herd-level networks were determined from sustained proximity interactions (pairs of cows continuously within three meters for 60 s or longer), and assessed for social differentiation, temporal stability, and the influence of individual-level characteristics such as lameness, parity, and days in milk. We determined the level of inter-individual variation in proximity interactions across the full barn housing, and for specific functional zones within it (feeding, non-feeding). The observed networks were highly connected and temporally varied, with significant preferential assortment, and inter-individual variation in daily interactions in the non-feeding zone.

The system consisted of 7 base stations and multiple tracker tags, and the determination of tags' positions was based on time of arrival (ToA). For locating stationary tags the system achieved 0.37 m accuracy at 1 m height and 0.50 m accuracy at 0.3 m height. While tracking moving tags at 1 m height 0.38 m accuracy was achieved. Three filters were tested to further improve the positioning performance. The median filter had the highest improvement on locating stationary and moving tags.

In commercial settings, automatic detection of pig behaviours through visual imaging remains a challenge due to farm demanding conditions, e.g., occlusion of one pig from another. Here, two deep learning-based detector methods were developed to identify pig postures and drinking behaviours of group-housed pigs. We first tested the system ability to detect changes in these measures at group-level during routine management. We then demonstrated the ability of our automated methods to identify behaviours of individual animals with a mean average precision of 0.989 ± 0.009 , under a variety of settings. When the pig feeding regime was disrupted, we automatically detected the expected deviations from the daily feeding routine in standing, lateral lying and drinking behaviours. These experiments demonstrate that the method is capable of robustly and accurately monitoring individual pig behaviours under commercial conditions, without the need for additional sensors or individual pig identification, hence providing a scalable technology to improve the health and well-being of farm animals. The method has the potential to transform how livestock are monitored and address issues in livestock farming, such as targeted treatment of individuals with medication. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"animal; animal behavior; body position; drinking behavior; health behavior; immunocompromised patient; physiology; pig; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Drinking Behavior; Health Behavior; Immunocompromised Host; Posture; Swine"

The aim of this paper is to describe how accelerometers can be used for welfare assessment based on the principles of the Welfare Quality assessment protocol. Algorithm development is based mainly on the detection of behavioural traits. So far, high accuracies have been found for movement and resting behaviours in cows and pigs, while algorithm development for feeding and drinking behaviours in pigs lag behind progress in cows where valid algorithms are already available. Welfare studies have used accelerometer technology to address the effects on behaviour of diet, daily cycle, enrichment, housing, social mixing, oestrus, lameness and disease.

This is challenging, since these properties are private and cannot be observed directly. Certain motivations, emotions and related internal states can be inferred in animals through experiments that involve choice, learning, generalization and decision-making. Yet, even though there is significant progress in elucidating the neurobiology of human consciousness, animal consciousness is still a mystery. We propose that computational animal welfare science emerges at the intersection of animal behaviour, welfare and computational cognition. By using ideas from cognitive science, we develop a functional and generic definition of subjective phenomena as any process or state of the organism that exists from the first-person perspective and cannot be isolated from the animal subject. We then outline a general cognitive architecture to model simple forms of subjective processes and sentience. This includes evolutionary adaptation which contains top-down attention modulation, predictive processing and subjective simulation by re-entrant (recursive) computations. Thereafter, we show how this approach uses major characteristics of the subjective experience: elementary self-awareness, global workspace and qualia with unity and continuity.

Behavioral variables generated by electronic feed and water bins have not been explored as potential predictors for estrus detection. The objectives of this study were: (i) to evaluate the effect of estrus expression on feed intake and animal behavior (feeding and drinking) and (ii) to develop and evaluate predictive approaches to detect estrus expression using electronic feed and water bins data. Feed intake, animal behavior, and estrus events were measured in 57 Holstein × Gyr heifers (374 ± 21.2 kg and 22.6 ± 0.60 months). Previous to each estrus event, the following covariates were computed: total feed intake (FI, as-fed basis), number of visits at the feed bins (VF) and water bins (VW), time spent eating (TE), and time spent drinking water (TD). Three predictive approaches were evaluated: Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF). Twelve covariate sets were established to investigate: (ii.a) the prediction quality for estrus detection when long (−174 to 0 h) or short (−24 to 0 h) time series were used as predictors (6 h of time window, with estrus event at 0 h); (ii.b) the ability of machine learning algorithms to predict estrus 6 and 12 h in advance; and (ii.c) the predictive quality for estrus detection when only feeding and drinking behavior data (without intake variables) were included as predictors. The predictive approaches were evaluated through Leave-One-Out Cross-validation. Estrus events altered feeding and drinking behavior patterns, and feed intake. ANN, RF, and GLM presented similar accuracies within covariate sets. There was no benefit of using longer time series for estrus detection. Earlier detection of estrus event (6 and 12 h in advance) reduced model accuracy compared to predictions performed at 0 h. However, ANN and RF showed accuracy values ranging between 75.7% and 96.5%, which indicates a great potential for early estrus detection. The exclusion of feed intake data of the covariate sets did not reduce the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the models for estrus detection. These findings suggest that behavioral data can early predict estrus events, which could be incorporated in sensor technologies capable of generating behavioral information, such as electronic bins, wearable sensors, and computer vision systems. © 2020","Artificial neural network; Heat detection; Machine learning; Precision livestock; Random forest","Animals; Decision trees; Feeding; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Potable water; Time series; Wearable sensors; Accurate prediction; Behavior patterns; Computer vision system; Generalized linear model; Leave-one-out cross validations; Machine learning techniques; Prediction quality; Sensor technologies; Machine learning; biomonitoring; cattle; computer vision; dairy farming; drinking water; feeding behavior; food supplementation; machine learning; sensor; time series analysis; Animalia"

Feeding behavior and feed intake have traditionally been determined by labour-intensive procedures such as human visual inspection and determination of feed refusals. However, the difficulty in manually collecting data at the time of feeding limits the extent of this type of monitoring. In order to overcome such limitations, optical techniques have been proposed in the last years as a fast-non-contact approach for feed weight/volume estimation. The present paper discusses the potential application of RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) technology for indirect estimation of the quantity of feed-ration present in the cow-feed alley. Experimental tests were carried out taking advantage of different amounts of feed ration for lactating cows (51.8% DM) composed by corn silage, alfalfa silage, hay, molasses, and concentrate. Preliminary results highlighted an interesting correlation (R2=0.90) between the minimum power demand for reading the RFID tags positioned on the feed-Alley and the quantity of feed-ration to analyze. As the quantities of feed-ration increased, the power demand increased, providing an indirect indication of the variation in quantity. Moreover, the evaluation of the height of the distributed feed-ration showed a high positive correlation (R2 = 0.96) with the minimum power requirement for reading the RFID tags positioned on the feed-Alley. The use of RFIDs on the feed-Alley represents an interesting solution to define both the quantity of ration to distribute and the evaluation of the residual feed-ration in the feed-Alley. © 2020 IEEE.","cow feed intake; dairy barn; feed weight estimation; precision livestock farming; RFID technology; smart livestock systems","Electric power utilization; Forestry; Frequency estimation; Timber; Experimental test; Feed efficiencies; Human visual inspection; Livestock farmers; Optical technique; Positive correlations; Power requirement; Weight estimation; Radio frequency identification (RFID)"

Several authors have verified the potential of infrared thermography (IRT) as noninvasive tool for monitoring the surface temperature of animals. In this study, machine learning-based models for the individual assessment of thermal stress levels in dairy cows (Holstein) were established and evaluated considering both weather and animal factors. An experiment was performed with 26 lactating cows, which were monitored during summer and winter (40 nonconsecutive days in total; three times a day) to acquire the weather and physiological data including the rectal temperature (RT), respiration rate (RR), and body surface temperature (BST), measured by IRT in different body area. The data were analyzed with the Pearson correlation coefficient to determine the ideal body part (front, ocular area, rib, and flank regions) for computational modeling. In addition, a data analysis with linear regression was performed to enhance the parameters choices. The models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) were developed based on the defined weather and physiological variables. The ANN-based models for predicting the RR (ANN-RR) and RT (ANN-RT) were established with Perceptron, feedforward, and multi-layered architectures. The model responses were used as classifiers for the thermal stress levels (comfort, alert, danger, and emergency). The classification efficiency was assessed with metrics extracted from the confusion matrices (accuracy) and compared with the results of traditional classification methods for thermal stress levels: the Temperature–Humidity Index (THI) and Black Globe-Humidity Index (BGHI). The ANN models provided better predictions of the RR and RT with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.74 (ANN-RR) and 0.71 (ANN-RT) than the linear regression models. With regard to thermal stress levels, the ANN-based models demonstrated a good predictive ability compared with the BGHI and THI classifications. The best thermal stress accuracy predictions with ANN-RR and ANN-RT were 83% and 84%, respectively; the best accuracies of the BGHI- and THI-based classifiers were 68% and 55%, respectively. In addition, the ANN-based classifier enables an individual assessment of the thermal stress levels of animals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Animal welfare; Data mining; Noninvasive measurement; Precision livestock farming; Thermal radiation","agricultural worker; animal experiment; animal model; animal welfare; article; artificial neural network; body regions; breathing rate; classifier; comfort; computer model; controlled study; correlation coefficient; dairy cattle; data analysis; data mining; human; humidity; linear regression analysis; non invasive measurement; nonhuman; perceptron; prediction; rectal temperature; rib; skin temperature; summer; temperature stress; thermography; weather; winter"

Most of this confusion arises because these are interconnected fields that emerged with the development of digital image acquisition. Thus, there is a need to understand the connection between these fields, how a digital image is formed, and the differences regarding the many sensors available, each best suited for different applications. From the advent of the charge-coupled devices demarking the birth of digital imaging, the field has advanced quite fast. Sensors have evolved from grayscale to color with increasingly higher resolution and better performance. Also, many other sensors have appeared, such as infrared cameras, stereo imaging, time of flight sensors, satellite, and hyperspectral imaging. There are also images generated by other signals, such as sound (ultrasound scanners and sonars) and radiation (standard x-ray and computed tomography), which are widely used to produce medical images. In animal and veterinary sciences, these sensors have been used in many applications, mostly under experimental conditions and with just some applications yet developed on commercial farms. Such applications can range from the assessment of beef cuts composition to live animal identification, tracking, behavior monitoring, and measurement of phenotypes of interest, such as body weight, condition score, and gait. Computer vision systems (CVS) have the potential to be used in precision livestock farming and high-throughput phenotyping applications. We believe that the constant measurement of traits through CVS can reduce management costs and optimize decision-making in livestock operations, in addition to opening new possibilities in selective breeding. Applications of CSV are currently a growing research area and there are already commercial products available. However, there are still challenges that demand research for the successful development of autonomous solutions capable of delivering critical information. This review intends to present significant developments that have been made in CVS applications in animal and veterinary sciences and to highlight areas in which further research is still needed before full deployment of CVS in breeding programs and commercial farms. © Copyright © 2020 Fernandes, Dórea and Rosa.","automation; computer vision; high-throughput phenotyping; imaging; livestock; phenotyping; precision livestock; sensors","automation; body composition; carcass; comparative study; computer vision; image analysis; image display; image processing; infrared radiation; livestock; meat; nonhuman; phenotype; prediction; Review; thermography; three-dimensional imaging"

The sensors usually used to measure several parameters from an individual dairy cow (RFID, Accelerometer, etc.) are invasive, uncomfortable and stressful for animals. To overcome these limits, we have developed a non-invasive system based entirely on image analysis. The top of the dairy cow's head image, captured in a dairy cow farm, was used as a Region of Interest (ROI) and different classifiers based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model are used to monitor the feeding behaviour and perform individual identification of seventeen Holstein dairy cows. We use one CNN to detect the dairy cow presence in the feeder zone. A second CNN is used to determine the dairy cow position in front of the feeder, standing or feeding. A third CNN is used to check the availability of food in the feeder and if so recognise the food category. The last CNN is devoted to individual identification of the dairy cow. Furthermore, we also explore the contribution of a CNN coupled to Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the combination of multiple CNNs in the individual identification process.

Protocols and indicators, such as those provided by Welfare Quality, mean that animal welfare can nowadays be regularly measured and surveyed at the farm level. However, the digital revolution in agriculture opens possibilities to quantify animal welfare using multiple sensors and data analytics. This allows daily monitoring of animal welfare at the group and individual animal level, for example, by measuring changes in behaviour patterns or physiological parameters. The present paper explores the potential for developing innovations in digital technologies to improve the management of animal welfare at the farm, during transport or at slaughter. We conclude that the innovations in Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) offer significant opportunities for a more holistic, evidence-based approach to the monitoring and surveillance of farmed animal welfare. To date, the emphasis in much PLF technologies has been on animal health and productivity. This paper argues that this emphasis should not come to define welfare. What is now needed is a coming together of industry, scientists, food chain actors, policy-makers and NGOs to develop and use the promise of PLF for the creative and effective improvement of farmed animal welfare. © 2020 by the authors.

In this work, we test its potential to classify jaw movements (JM) according to type (bite, chew, chew-bite), activity (grazing or rumination), and forage species being consumed. Experiments with cows and sheep grazing and ruminating several forages were conducted. First, each JM was manually identified, classified and described by two sets of sound features: i) one containing energy bands of the spectrum ((Formula presented.)), and ii) one containing four complementary (or global) variables ((Formula presented.)). Two models were evaluated, one with (Formula presented.) alone and the other one combining (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.). Jaw movements were correctly classified by type with 73.0% and 78.5% average accuracy. Accuracy was better for cows than sheep (85 vs 66%). Simultaneous identification of the type of JM and plant species was about 78%. Classification accuracy of activity based on chews averaged 68.5% and 77.0% for rumination and grazing.

Sensors present exciting opportunities for sustained, real-time, non-intrusive measurement of farm animal behavioral, mental, and physiological parameters with the integration of nanotechnology and instrumentation. This paper critically reviews the sensing technology and sensor data-based models used to explore biological systems such as animal behavior, energy metabolism, epidemiology, immunity, health, and animal reproduction. The use of sensor technology to assess physiological parameters can provide tremendous benefits and tools to overcome and minimize production losses while making positive contributions to animal welfare. Of course, sensor technology is not free from challenges; these devices are at times highly sensitive and prone to damage from dirt, dust, sunlight, color, fur, feathers, and environmental forces. Rural farmers unfamiliar with the technologies must be convinced and taught to use sensor-based technologies in farming and livestock management. While there is no doubt that demand will grow for non-invasive sensor-based technologies that require minimum contact with animals and can provide remote access to data, their true success lies in the acceptance of these technologies by the livestock industry. © 2020 by the authors.

Virtual fence (VF) systems have been successfully used to contain animals within predefined boundaries. Accordingly, utilisation of a VF system to enhance automated allocation of correct forage areas to animals would represent a major advancement for grazing management strategies. Traditional VF systems rely on a perimeter cable to establish the boundary line, and this then needs to be deployed and physically moved to alter the parameters of the boundary. In our study, wearable GPS technology was used to implement a VF system without the need for such cabling. To accomplish this, we designed and developed a VF system comprised of a wearable collar with associated on-farm communication infrastructure. Moreover, we attempted to train dairy cows to associate an audio warning stimulus with boundary encroachment. Overall, the operating capacity of the cow-collar and the communications network were found to be robust. However, although dairy cows rapidly associated visual cues with VF boundary lines, and quickly developed a cue-consequence association between the audio warning and corrective stimulus, the number of boundary challenges made by cows increased upon removal of all visual cues. In addition, we observed a reduction in time spent grazing and ruminating during the training period, which suggested cows had become stressed within the designated inclusion zone. Nevertheless, our results are preliminary and further experimental work is required to truly assess best implementation protocols for virtual fencing without visual cues. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Animal training; Cue-consequence; Farming; Grazing-allocation; Precision Livestock; Virtual fence system; Wearable technology","Animals; Boundary lines; Communication infrastructure; Communications networks; Farming system; GPS technologies; Grazing management; Operating capacity; Visual cues; Wearable technology; communication; GPS; grazing management; visual cue; Animalia"

It consequently may modify how farmers consider their animals, the quality of the human-animal relationship and animal welfare. To better understand how new technologies impact human-animal relationships on the farm, a survey was carried out on 25 livestock farms in France. The farms raised dairy cows, gestating sows or broiler chickens using different equipment (sensors associated or not with robots). A qualitative thematic analysis to better identify farmers’ views on the different topics, and secondly a statistical analysis to identify if farmer profiles exist and to better understand the diversity of views were conducted. Most of the farmers expressed satisfaction about working with the new technology because their work becomes easier and allows more control over the management of the animals. Using PLF, the farmers describe a profession that has not fundamentally changed but which involves new tasks, new skills and daily schedules. Three farmers’ profiles were identified. Profile A farmers consider that one cannot talk about a human-animal relationship on their farm, and do not enjoy either touching or talking to their animals. Profile B farmers associate a good human-animal relationship with the animals’ welfare. Profile C is characterized by the central place occupied by animals and associate a good human-animal relationship with an absence of fear on the part of the animals. Farmers motivated by animals (profile C) find in precision livestock farming benefits related to animals, while the others (profiles A and B) find technical benefits detached from the animals. The farmers have room to manoeuvre in how they use the equipment; this can be seen for instance in the degree to which tasks are delegated to the equipment, which can be partial or total. Nevertheless, some farmers expressed concerns regarding the place of the new technologies on the farm, such as the risk of losing their own autonomy or their ability to observe animals and detect problems.

With advances in precision farming, it is now possible to evaluate the growth performance of individual pigs more accurately. However, important traits such as muscle and fat deposition can still be evaluated only via ultrasound, computed tomography, or dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Therefore, the objectives of this study were: 1) to develop a CVS for prediction of live BW, muscle depth (MD), and back fat (BF) from top view 3D images of finishing pigs and 2) to compare the predictive ability of different approaches, such as traditional multiple linear regression, partial least squares, and machine learning techniques, including elastic networks, artificial neural networks, and deep learning (DL). A dataset containing over 12,000 images from 557 finishing pigs (average BW of 120 Â± 12 kg) was split into training and testing sets using a 5-fold cross-validation (CV) technique so that 80% and 20% of the dataset were used for training and testing in each fold. Several image features, such as volume, area, length, widths, heights, polar image descriptors, and polar Fourier transforms, were extracted from the images and used as predictor variables in the different approaches evaluated. In addition, DL image encoders that take raw 3D images as input were also tested. This latter method achieved the best overall performance, with the lowest mean absolute scaled error (MASE) and root mean square error for all traits, and the highest predictive squared correlation (R2). The median predicted MASE achieved by this method was 2.69, 5.02, and 13.56, and R2 of 0.86, 0.50, and 0.45, for BW, MD, and BF, respectively. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that it is possible to successfully predict BW, MD, and BF via CVS on a fully automated setting using 3D images collected in farm conditions. Moreover, DL algorithms simplified and optimized the data analytics workflow, with raw 3D images used as direct inputs, without requiring prior image processing. © The Author(s) 2020.","Body composition; Image analysis; Machine learning; Precision livestock farming; Ultrasound","algorithm; anatomy and histology; animal; body composition; body weight; comparative study; echography; human; image processing; machine learning; muscle; phenotype; physiology; pig; procedures; statistical model; veterinary medicine; x-ray computed tomography; Algorithms; Animals; Body Composition; Body Weight; Data Science; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Linear Models; Machine Learning; Muscles; Neural Networks, Computer; Phenotype; Swine; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Ultrasonography"

However, there is still a need to integrate data from single sources to obtain a complete picture of the welfare of an animal. This review offers a basis for developing integrated automatic systems to assess dairy cow welfare by providing an overview of the main issues that challenge cow welfare (e.g., lameness) and of well-established indicators that could detect these issues on the farm. Based on a literature review of 4 reviews on cow welfare in general and 48 reviews on single welfare issues, we identified 18 different major welfare issues and 76 matching indicators that could be detected automatically on the farm. Several indicators, e.g., feed intake, showed a consistent association with welfare across many different issues. Although some of these indicators are discussed critically, this means there are many indicators that potentially could detect reduced welfare in general. Other types of indicators could detect one specific welfare issue, e.g., increased respiratory rate for heat stress. These different types of indicators combined provide a basis to develop integrated automatic systems that ultimately would help farmers to detect welfare problems at an early stage. © 2020 by the authors.

Many modern farms today have milk meters and activity sensors that accurately measure yield and activity at a high frequency for monitoring purposes. We hypothesized that these same sensors can be used for precision phenotyping of complex traits such as lifetime resilience or productive life span. The objective of this study was to investigate whether lifetime resilience and productive life span of dairy cows can be predicted using sensor-derived proxies of first-parity sensor data. We used a data set from 27 Belgian and British dairy farms with an automated milking system containing at least 5 yr of successive measurements. All of these farms had milk meter data available, and 13 of these farms were also equipped with activity sensors. This subset was used to investigate the added value of activity meters to improve the model's prediction accuracy. To rank cows for lifetime resilience, a score was attributed to each cow based on her number of calvings, her 305-d milk yield, her age at first calving, her calving intervals, and the DIM at the moment of culling, taking her entire lifetime into account. Next, this lifetime resilience score was used to rank the cows within their herd, resulting in a lifetime resilience ranking. Based on this ranking, cows were classified in a low (last third), moderate (middle third), or high (first third) resilience category within farm. In total, 45 biologically sound sensor features were defined from the time series data, including measures of variability, lactation curve shape, milk yield perturbations, activity spikes indicating estrous events, and activity dynamics representing health events (e.g., drops in daily activity). These features, calculated on first-lactation data, were used to predict the lifetime resilience rank and, thus, to predict the classification within the herd (low, moderate, or high). Using a specific linear regression model progressively including features stepwise selected at farm level (cutoff P-value of 0.2), classification performances were between 35.9 and 70.0% (46.7 ± 8.0, mean ± SD) for milk yield features only, and between 46.7 and 84.0% (55.5 ± 12.1, mean ± SD) for lactation and activity features together. This is, respectively, 13.7 and 22.2% higher than what random classification would give. Moreover, using these individual farm models, only 3.5 and 2.3% of cows were classified high when they were actually low, or vice versa, whereas respectively 91.8 and 94.1% of wrongly classified animals were predicted in an adjacent category. The sensor features retained in the prediction equation of the individual farms differed across farms, which demonstrates the variability in culling and management strategies across farms and within farms over time. This lack of a common model structure across farms suggests the need to consider local (and evidence-based) culling management rules when developing decision support tools for dairy farms. With this study we showed the potential of precision phenotyping of complex traits based on biologically meaningful features derived from readily available sensor data. We conclude that first-lactation milk and activity sensor data have the potential to predict cows' lifetime resilience rankings within farms but that consistency between farms is currently lacking. © 2020 American Dairy Science Association","longevity; precision livestock farming; precision phenotyping; prediction model; resilience","agricultural land; animal; bovine; female; lactation; longevity; metabolism; milk; parity; physiology; pregnancy; reproduction; Animals; Cattle; Farms; Female; Lactation; Longevity; Milk; Parity; Pregnancy; Reproduction"

PLF has started being adopted only recently, but the need of technological support on farm is getting more and more important and is facilitating its distribution on farms. A huge number of researches and scientific studies are available in literature about the adoption of technology, sensors and computer tools for almost all reared species. In this literature review, the goal is to study the recent progresses of PLF, and in particular the scientific studies carried out in the last 7 years (2013–2019) on dairy cattle farming. Health, welfare and production aspects were taken into account together with animal behaviour, environmental barn conditions and their effect on the three pillars of sustainability: environmental, economic and social. From the main findings, it can be underlined that PLF brings environmental, economic and social sustainability benefits on farms, but these benefits have not yet been quantified through specific methods for sustainability assessments. Therefore, it is important for near future researches to focus not only on the technological improvements of tools and sensors but also on the aspects of environmental, economic and social sustainability of livestock productions that impact on both farmers and the community and consumers. The role of PLF is more and more important and will support the process of decision-making of farmers, change their role on farm and their management view, and make possible the traceability of products and the control of the quality of products and of the animals living conditions as required from policy-makers and stakeholders. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Data collection; Efficiency improvement; Farm monitoring; Performance indicators; Sensors; Sustainability","Agriculture; Animals; Behavioral research; Decision making; Sensors; Data collection; Efficiency improvement; Performance indicators; Precision livestock farming; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable production; Technological improvements; Technological supports; Sustainable development"

An increase in subdermal temperature, reflective of vasodilation, could, we surmised, potentially detect the level of heat stress. This could provide a better way to control dairy-barn cooling systems, which are commonly controlled solely on the basis of either air temperature or some other such non-ideal environmental parameters. Concurrent with the development of new technologies, the Long-Range (LoRa) wireless communication technology and a concept known as the “Internet of Things” (IoT) were utilized to extract temperature data from the base of a cow's ear every 30 s in real-time. To test the method, an implant temperature sensor was injected, at the base of the ear, into three Holstein cows, and each was equipped with a wearable RFID scanner (mounted on an existing collar) for five days during a summer season in Wisconsin. The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of using implantable biosensors and wireless communication technology to monitor the heat-stress levels experienced by these dairy cows, in real-time, over the five days. Overall, the recorded subdermal temperature data obtained from implantable biosensors closely corresponded to the changes that occurred in core (vaginal) body temperature, and the developed wireless communication nodes successfully measured and monitored the temperature readings in real-time. Each cow showed different heat stress responses despite the fact that all three were in virtually the same location and subject to the same temperature-humidity index (THI) throughout the study. The study also found that the temperature readings obtained by the implantable biosensor began to more closely match in value the corresponding core body temperature (CBT) readings as the THI increased. Furthermore, the CBT of a cow could be reasonably predicted by applying a machine-learning (ML) algorithm to measured subdermal-temperature and THI data. The present study also found that the dairy cows tested displayed no obvious adverse effects that could have resulted from the biosensor implanted at the base of the ear. This study's findings should serve as the first step toward any future research and development that may take place in the field of precision agriculture, especially research that considers even smaller and more practical electronics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Dairy cow; Heat stress; Implantable biosensor; Real-time monitoring; Wearable wireless transmitter","Agricultural robots; Biosensors; Cooling systems; Dairies; Farm buildings; Internet of things; Machine learning; Physiology; Scanning; Thermal stress; Wearable technology; Environmental parameter; Implant temperature; Implantable biosensors; Minimally invasive; Research and development; Temperature humidity index; Wireless communication technology; Wireless communications; Radio frequency identification (RFID); agricultural technology; body temperature; cattle; cooling; electronic equipment; Internet; livestock farming; precision agriculture; real time; sensor; United States; Wisconsin; Bos"

In this sense, precision livestock farming proposes to optimize livestock production using information and communication technologies for monitoring animals. Although there are several methodologies for monitoring foraging behavior, the acoustic method has shown to be successful in previous studies. However, there is no online acoustic method for the recognition of rumination and grazing bouts that can be implemented in a low-cost device. In this study, an online algorithm called bottom-up foraging activity recognizer (BUFAR) is proposed. The method is based on the recognition of jaw movements from sound, which are then analyzed by groups to recognize rumination and grazing bouts. Two variants of the activity recognizer were explored, which were based on a multilayer perceptron (BUFAR-MLP) and a decision tree (BUFAR-DT). These variants were evaluated and compared under the same conditions with a known method for offline analysis. Compared to the former method, the proposed method showed superior results in the estimation of grazing and rumination bouts. The MLP-variant showed the best results, reaching F1-scores higher than 0.75 for both activities. In addition, the MLP-variant outperformed a commercial rumination time estimation system. A great advantage of BUFAR is the low computational cost, which is about 50 times lower than that corresponding to the former method. The good performance and low computational cost makes BUFAR a highly feasible method for real-time execution in a low-cost embedded monitoring system. The advantages provided by this system will allow the development of a portable device for online monitoring of the foraging behavior of ruminants.

Distress calls are a catch-all response to a range of environmental stressors, and elicit food calling and brooding from hens. Pharmacological and behavioural laboratory studies link expression of this call with negative affective state. As such, there is an a priori expectation that distress calls on farms indicate not only physical, but emotional welfare. Using whole-house recordings on 12 commercial broiler flocks (n = 25 090-26 510/flock), we show that early life (day 1-4 of placement) distress call rate can be simply and linearly estimated using a single acoustic parameter: spectral entropy. After filtering to remove low-frequency machinery noise, spectral entropy per minute of recording had a correlation of -0.88 with a manual distress call count. In videos collected on days 1-3, age-specific behavioural correlates of distress calling were identified: calling was prevalent (spectral entropy low) when foraging/drinking were high on day 1, but when chicks exhibited thermoregulatory behaviours or were behaviourally asynchronous thereafter. Crucially, spectral entropy was predictive of important commercial and welfare-relevant measures: low median daily spectral entropy predicted low weight gain and high mortality, not only into the next day, but towards the end of production. Further research is required to identify what triggers, and thus could alleviate, distress calling in broiler chicks. However, within the field of precision livestock farming, this work shows the potential for simple descriptors of the overall acoustic environment to be a novel, tractable and real-time 'iceberg indicator' of current and future welfare. © 2020 The Authors.","animal welfare; bioacoustics; Gallus gallus domesticus; iceberg indicator; precision livestock farming","Agriculture; Animals; Entropy; Machinery; Sea ice; Acoustic environment; Acoustic parameters; Affective state; Environmental stressors; Laboratory studies; Precision livestock farming; Spectral entropy; Thermoregulatory; Spectrum analysis; animal welfare; Article; body weight gain; broiler; chicken; drinking; early life stress; electric potential; entropy; foraging; hen; livestock; mortality; noise; nonhuman"

It is an important management tool for maximising milk production and reproduction efficiency while reducing the incidence of metabolic and peripartum diseases. The feasibility of estimating the BCS by computer vision has been demonstrated in recent research. However, the techniques explored to date may be limited in dynamic backgrounds or in applications for an imbalanced dataset of cows' BCS, which is likely to be encountered in dairy farming. In this study, a dynamic background model (Gaussian Mixture Model, GMM) was used to separate the cow from the background. Then, a series of image processing algorithms were proposed for quantifying the indicators used in manual scoring, including global features and local features. Finally, an ensemble learning approach was used to model the imbalanced dataset. The results demonstrate that applying GMM on depth images can eliminate the difficulty of object detection caused by background changes. The image processing algorithms can automatically acquire valid images, locate regions of interest and extract image features without any manual intervention. In 5-fold cross-validation, the ensemble model achieved an average accuracy of 56% within 0.125-point deviation, 76% within 0.25-point deviations and 94% within 0.5-point deviations.

The aim of this study was to develop and test a novel pecking activity detection tool for potential use on turkey farms by means of acoustic data and a convolutional neural networks (CNN) model. Under near to commercial conditions, two metallic balls were used as pecking objects and suspended from the ceiling. Each pecking object was equipped with a microphone connected via a cable to a top view camera positioned on the ceiling. The recorded sound data were sampled in slots of 1 s and high pass filtering was performed to eliminate background noises. A total of 9200 filtered sound files were used for training and validation, and 3900 for testing set.

The behaviour of cows is known to change in the hours prior to parturition, for example, less time ruminating and eating and increased activity level and tail-raise events. These behaviours can be monitored non-invasively using animal-mounted sensors. Thus, behavioural traits are ideal variables for the prediction of calving. This study explored the potential of two sensor technologies for their capabilities in predicting when calf expulsion should be expected. Two trials were conducted at separate locations: (i) beef cows (n = 144) and (ii) dairy cows (n = 110). Two sensors were deployed on each cow: (1) Afimilk Silent Herdsman (SHM) collars monitoring time spent ruminating (RUM), eating (EAT) and the relative activity level (ACT) of the cow, and (2) tail-mounted Axivity accelerometers to detect tail-raise events (TAIL). The exact time the calf was expelled from the cow was determined by viewing closed-circuit television camera footage. Machine learning random forest algorithms were developed to predict when calf expulsion should be expected using single-sensor variables and by integrating multiple-sensor data-streams. The performance of the models was tested using the Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), the area under the curve, and the sensitivity and specificity of predictions. The TAIL model was slightly better at predicting calving within a 5-h window for beef cows (MCC = 0.31) than for dairy cows (MCC = 0.29). The TAIL + RUM + EAT models were equally as good at predicting calving within a 5-h window for beef and dairy cows (MCC = 0.32 for both models). Combining data-streams from SHM and tail sensors did not substantially improve model performance over tail sensors alone; therefore, hour-by-hour algorithms for the prediction of time of calf expulsion were developed using tail sensor data. Optimal classification occurred at 2 h prior to calving for both beef (MCC = 0.29) and dairy cows (MCC = 0.25). This study showed that tail sensors alone are adequate for the prediction of parturition and that the optimal time for prediction is 2 h before expulsion of the calf. © 2020 The Animal Consortium.","animal-mounted sensors; bovine; parturition; precision livestock farming; random forest","animal; birth; bovine; devices; eating; female; machine learning; phenotype; physiologic monitoring; physiology; pregnancy; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; veterinary medicine; Animals; Cattle; Eating; Female; Machine Learning; Monitoring, Physiologic; Parturition; Phenotype; Pregnancy; Sensitivity and Specificity"

Since animals act based on habits, the real-time monitoring data logger has become an indispensable instrument to assist farmers in recognizing the status of livestock. Position-tracked and acoustic monitoring have become commonplace as two of the best methods to characterize feeding performance in ruminants. Previously, the existing methods were limited to desktop computers and lacked a sound-collecting function. These restrictions impacted the late interventions from feeders and required a large-sized data memory. In this work, an open-source framework for a data collector that autonomously captures the health information of farm animals is introduced. In this portable hardware, a Wireless Location Acoustic Sensing System (WiLASS) is integrated to infer the health status through the activities and abnormal phenomena of farming livestock via chew–bite sound identification. WiLASS involves the open modules of ESP32-WROOM, GPS NEO-6M, ADXL335 accelerometer, GY-MAX4466 amplifier, temperature sensors, and other signal processing circuits. By means of wireless communication, the ESP32-WROOM Thing micro-processor offers high speed transmission, standard protocol, and low power consumption. Data are transferred in a real-time manner from the attached sensing modules to a digital server for further analysis. The module of GPS NEO-6M Thing brings about fast tracking, high precision, and a strong signal, which is suitable for highland applications. Some computations are incorporated into the accelerometer to estimate directional movement and vibration. The GY-MAX4466 Thing plays the role of microphone, which is used to store environmental sound. To ensure the quality of auditory data, they are recorded at a minimum sampling frequency of 10 KHz and at a 12-bit resolution. Moreover, a mobile software in pocket devices is implemented to provide extended mobility and social convenience. Converging with a cloud-based server, the multi-Thing portable platform can provide access to simultaneously supervise. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol with low bandwidth, high reliability, and bi-direction, and which is appropriate for most operating systemsOS, is embedded into the system to prevent data loss. From the experimental results, the feasibility, effectiveness, and correctness of our approach are verified. Under the changes of climate, the proposed framework not only supports the improvement of farming techniques, but also provides a high-quality alternative for poor rural areas because of its low cost and its ability to carry out a proper policy for each species. © 2020 by the authors.

Individual feed intake of dairy cows is an important variable currently unavailable in commercial dairies. An RGB-D camera was positioned above the feeding area in an open cowshed. Feed intake was estimated by combining information from the RGB and depth images. Cow identification was conducted using the RGB image. Deep learning algorithms for identification and intake estimation were developed using CNN models. Data for CNN training were acquired by a specially developed automatic data acquisition system. A range of feed weights under varied configurations were collected over a period of seven days with the setup, which included an automatic scale, cameras, and a micro-controller. Test data for feed intake was acquired in an open cowshed research dairy farm, wherein the cows were fed Total Mix Ration (TMR). Images of cows eating over a period of 36 h provided the test data for cow identification. The system was able to accurately identify 93.65% of the cows. The amount of feed consumed, which ranged from 0 to 8 kg per meal, was measured with mean absolute and square errors (MAE and MSE) of 0.127 kg, and 0.034kg2 respectively. The analysis showed that the amount and diversity of data are important for model training. Better results were achieved for the model that was trained with high-diversity data than the model trained with homogeneous data (MAE of 1.025 kg, and MSE of 2.845 kg2 for a model trained on shadow conditions only). Additionally, the training analysis shows that the model based on RGB-D data shows better results than the model based on depth channel data without RGB (MAE of 0.241 kg, and MSE of 0.106 kg2). These results suggest the potential of low-cost cameras for individual feed intake measurements in advanced dairy farms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional neural networks (CNN); Deep learning; Individual cow feed intake; precision livestock farming (PLF); RGB-D camera","Cameras; Computer vision; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Costs; Data acquisition; Deep neural networks; Farms; Green computing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Scales (weighing instruments); Automatic data acquisition; Computer vision system; Design and implementations; Feed intake; Model training; Model-based OPC; Precision livestock farming; Rgb-d cameras; Deep learning; artificial neural network; automation; cattle; computer vision; data acquisition; design; food intake; identification method; image analysis; learning; measurement method; training"

Consequently, HR monitoring is becoming increasingly important in research of farm animals, not only for production efficiency, but also for animal welfare. Real-time HR monitoring for humans has become feasible though there are still shortcomings for continuously accurate measuring. This paper is an effort to estimate whether it is realistic to get a continuous HR sensor for livestock that can be used for long term monitoring. The review provides the reported techniques to monitor HR of living organisms by emphasizing their principles, advantages, and drawbacks. Various properties and capabilities of these techniques are compared to check the potential to transfer the mostly adequate sensor technology of humans to livestock in term of application. Based upon this review, we conclude that the photoplethysmographic (PPG) technique seems feasible for implementation in livestock. Therefore, we present the contributions to overcome challenges to evolve to better solutions. Our study indicates that it is realistic today to develop a PPG sensor able to be integrated into an ear tag for mid-sized and larger farm animals for continuously and accurately monitoring their HRs. © 2020 by the authors.

With respect to cow identification, methods based on computer vision have been widely considered due to their advantage of non-contact and practicality. In this paper, a novel non-contact cow identification method based on fusion of deep parts features is proposed. First, a set of side-view images of cows were captured, and then the YOLO object detection model was applied to locate the cow object in each original image, which was then divided into three parts, head, trunk and legs, by a part segmentation algorithm using frame differencing and segmentation span analysis. Then, three independent convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained to extract deep features from these three parts, and a feature fusion strategy was designed to fuse the features, i.e., deep parts feature fusion. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained by the fused features was used to identify each individual cow. The proposed method achieved 98.36% cow identification accuracy on a dataset containing side-view images of 93 cows, which outperformed existing works. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed cow identification method and the good potential for this method in individual identification of other livestock. © 2020 IAgrE","Computer vision; Convolutional neural networks; Cow identification; Deep parts feature fusion; Precision livestock farming","Agriculture; Computer vision; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Image segmentation; Object detection; Support vector machines; Behaviour analysis; Feature fusion; Frame differencing; Identification accuracy; Identification method; Individual identification; Precision livestock farming; Segmentation algorithms; Automatic identification"

However, no commercial solutions are available for the agricultural field, despite the potential of this technology to help farmers. Many head-wearable devices in development possess a variety of features that may affect the smartglasses wearing experience. Over the last decades, dairy farms have adopted new technologies to improve their productivity and profit. However, there remains a gap in the literature as regards the application of augmented reality in livestock farms. Head-wearable devices may offer invaluable benefits to farmers, allowing real-time information monitoring of each animal during on-farm activities.

Sixteen participants performed the identification and grouping trials in the milking parlor, reading different types of contents on the augmented reality device optical display. Two questionnaires were used to evaluate the perceived workload and usability of the device.

To meet this demand, one candidate mechanism to increase production is to increase housing and manage more birds. However, this practice, along with labour shortages and increasing biosecurity practices will make it increasingly difficult for producers to monitor the production, health, and welfare status of all their birds. Employing smart poultry management systems is necessary to increase production while minimizing costs and the use of resources. Smart poultry management systems include precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies such as smart sensors, automation of farm processes, and data driven decision making platforms. Many new technologies will have great implications for poultry production in the areas of the poultry house environment, bird welfare, precision feeding, and rapid detection of infectious disease. As smart sensors collect data in real-time on a variety of parameters from poultry operations, large amounts of data will be generated. To make best use of this data, big data analytical tools must be employed to produce data driven decisions. Additionally, the devices that will be incorporated into smart poultry management systems will be connected to the Internet allowing for the formation of Internet of things (IoT) farm networks. IoT technologies allow for communication between farm sensors, devices, and equipment, and will lead to the automation of multiple farm procedures. The following review discusses the areas of impact that new smart sensor technologies will have on poultry operations and describes how sensor technology is related to big data analytics and IoT systems, and how these technologies can enhance production in the poultry industry.

A total of 57 studies were reviewed wherein all principles of broiler welfare were addressed. The ""good health"" principle was the main criteria found to be addressed by ITs and IT-based studies (45.6% and 46.1%, respectively), whereas the least observed principle was ""good feeding"" (8.8%). This review also classified ITs and IT-based studies by their utilization (location, production system, variable measured, aspect of production, and experimental/practical use). The results show that the current focus of ITs is on problems with conventional production systems and that less attention has been given to free-range systems, slaughterhouses, and supply chain issues.

We have focused on the Agricultural Intelligent Automation Systems which have a high potential to be applied to agricultural production and processing, especially with applicability to poultry production. Most of the published work on agricultural robotics has been in the areas of perception and reasoning. The emphases have been in the identification of objects, evaluation of product quality, monitoring of plant and animal growth and development, yield prediction, and machine guidance. There has been limited published work on the task execution and systems integration aspects of agricultural robotics. Moreover, we have reviewed agricultural robotics research from 24 universities worldwide. Agricultural robots can be divided into three categories (monitor, harvester, and both) according to various functions. Several tables are presented to summarize the information on the key subject areas reviewed in this article. We have found that there are still many challenges that need to be addressed in robotizing agricultural tasks in general and in poultry production specifically. The most common challenges in robotics applications have been developing robots for specific agricultural tasks. Examples in poultry production include monitoring environmental conditions and chicken health, egg picking, and encouraging chicken movement. The approaches to addressing the technical needs have been creating intelligent movable machines for use alongside the chickens in poultry house. The most noticeable results include Octopus Poultry Safe (OPS) robot for sanitizing poultry houses autonomously, PoultryBot for picking floor eggs, and Spoutnic for training hens to move.

In this context, the article focuses on the adoption of electronic sensors and measuring devices, electronic controls and electronic data-processing options and the usage of robotics in ruminant farming, namely, for dairy cattle, dairy goats, suckler cows, beef cattle and meat-sheep. Furthermore, the use of electronic ear tags for pigs and the smartphone usage for barn monitoring on poultry farms was assessed. To better understand the adoption process, farm and farmer's characteristics associated with the adoption of (1) implemented and (2) new digital technologies in ruminant farming were assessed using regression analyses, which is classified at a 10% adoption hurdle.

Easy-to-use sensors and measuring devices such as those integrated in the milking parlour were more widespread than data processing technologies such as those used for disease detection. The husbandry system further determined the use of digital technologies, with the result that farmers with tie stall barns were less likely to use digital technologies than farmers with loose housing systems. Additional studies of farmers’ determinants and prospects of implementation can help identify barriers in the adoption of digital technologies. © 2020 The Animal Consortium","farm characteristics; precision livestock farming; ruminants; small-scale farming; survey","agricultural land; agriculture; animal; animal husbandry; bovine; female; livestock; pig; ruminant; sheep; Agriculture; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Cattle; Digital Technology; Farms; Female; Livestock; Ruminants; Sheep; Swine"

These factors taken together mean that every opportunity to optimise the production process must be considered to boost bird weight gain while at the same time reducing resource investment and risk of major incidents. Because of this, the last decade has seen the introduction of Precision Livestock Farming techniques to the broiler production industry. In this paper, we review the emergence and trends in Precision Livestock Farming in the broiler production industry by examining both in-market and laboratory based advances for this sector. The review spans three tiers of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) that together form the basis for an integrated precision farming solution for poultry. These three tiers are Sensor Technology, Data Collection and Integration Frameworks, and Data Analysis and Processing. These tiers are reviewed in the context of intensive poultry farming. In addition to examining, the trends seen in the broiler production industry a number of prominent directions in related agri-food domains are also examined to gain a better insight into where Precision Farming for broiler production industry can be expected to move over the next decade. © 2020, Int.

To be able to achieve sustainable supply of livestock products, efficient farm management is a necessity. With the advancement in technology it also brought innovations that could be harness in order to achieve better productivity in animal production and agriculture. Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) is a budding concept of making use of smart sensors or available devices to automatically and continuously monitor and manage livestock production. With this concept, this paper introduces a swine management system that integrates image processing technique for weight monitoring. This system captures pig images using camera, evaluate and estimate the weight base on the captured image. It is comprised of several management modules to help swine farm administrators better understand the performance and situation of the swine farm. This paper aims to improve the management in both small and big livestock raisers. Based on the experiment comparing the actual weight and the computed image weight using pixel, there is an average margin of error of ±0.041% and it clearly shows that it is a good alternative to use the system to avoid the stress of weighing the livestock. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The current conditions and the expected developments of the dairy sector highlight a strong need for more efficient and sustainable farming systems. Studying heat stress, herd management and housing and animals’ productive and reproductive performances is fundamental for the economic and environmental sustainability of the dairy chain. New and effective tools to cope with these challenges have been provided by Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), which is nowadays increasingly applied and makes possible to control quali-quantitative parameters related to production, health, behaviour, and real-time locomotion per animal. The research key challenge is to turn these data into knowledge to provide real-time support in farming optimisation.

For instance, Thermipig model represents the pig fattening room and simulates performances of pigs at the batch level, taking into account interactions between the individual variability of pigs, farmer's practices, room characteristics and outdoor climate conditions. The model requires some static basic inputs fulfilled in several spreadsheets (such as rooms, pigs, and dietary characteristics) but also data files for voluminous variable inputs (such as outdoor temperature or climate control box parameters) for further modelling and outcome producing. This leads to challenges in data providing by the farmers and have to be improved. This paper deals with the implementation of the separate modules of the developed data warehouse system for usability improvements of the Thermipig model. The idea is to substitute input from the data files with online data input and automated variable processing by the model using the python script for connection to the remote data warehouse. The data warehouse system is extended with ‘Property Sets’ section dealing with all the operations that can be performed to a set of input variables. This approach demonstrates the ability of the data warehouse to act as data supplier for the remote model.

Indeed, studies have proven that the agricultural sector presents an area of tension and often attracts skepticism concerning new technologies. Digital technologies have become increasingly popular in agriculture. Yet there are almost no investigations on the public acceptance of digitalization in agriculture so far. Our online survey provides initial insights to reduce this knowledge gap. The sample (n = 2012) represents the German population in terms of gender, age (minimum 18 years), education and size of place of residence. Results showed that if the potential of digital farming technologies (DFT) regarding animal welfare and environmental protection was described, respondents reacted positively. Thus, the general attitudes of respondents toward the benefits of DFT were mostly positive. The approval to increasing adoption rates of particular DFT by providing subsidies was also high. Linear regression models showed that the dominant positive influences on respondents’ attitudes toward the benefits of DFT were a generally positive attitude toward farming and a strong trust in farmers in Germany. Confronting respondents with pictures showing DFT resulted in many spontaneous negative associations and general criticism of agricultural production. The latter holds true for DFT in animal husbandry in particular. However, as agriculture as a whole is criticized by many groups in Germany, it is unlikely that benefits from digitalization will significantly increase the public acceptance of agriculture as a whole. © 2020, The Author(s).","Dairy; Precision crop farming; Precision livestock farming; Robot; Spontaneous associations",

Good animal welfare promotes the healthy growth of poultry, which can reduce the disease rate and improve the production quality and capacity. As behaviour responses are an important expression of welfare, the study of behaviour is a simple and non-invasive method to assess animal welfare. The use of modern technology offers the possibility to monitor the behaviour of broilers and laying hens in a continuous and automated way. This paper reviews the latest technologies used for monitoring the behaviour of broilers and laying hens under both experimental conditions and commercial applications and discusses the potential of developing a precision livestock farming (PLF) system. The techniques that are presented and discussed include sound analysis, which can be an online tool to automatically monitor poultry behaviour non-invasively at the group level; wireless, wearable sensors with radio-frequency identification devices, which can automatically identify individual chickens, track the location and movement of individuals in real time and quantify some behavioural traits accordingly and image processing technology, which can be considered a direct tool for measuring behaviours, especially activity behaviours and disease early warning. All of these technologies can monitor and analyse poultry behaviour, at the group level or individual level, on commercial farms. However, the popularity and adoption of these technologies has been hampered by the logistics of applying them to thousands and tens of thousands of birds on commercial farms. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques in commercial applications and presents evidence that they provide potential tools to automatically monitor the behaviours of broilers and laying hens on commercial farms. However, there still has a long way to go to develop a PLF system to detect and predict abnormal situations. © 2019 The Animal Consortium","behaviour detection; image processing; radio-frequency identification; sound analysis; welfare assessment","agricultural land; animal; animal husbandry; animal welfare; chicken; female; livestock; motivation; Animal Husbandry; Animal Welfare; Animals; Chickens; Farms; Female; Goals; Livestock"

But sensor-type devices have the potential to cause stress on the cattle by attaching them, and there are additional cost issues for maintenance. In this study, to solve the above problems, we present a estrus detection system which used regular CCTV and applied the object detection algorithm based on the deep learning model.

Best practice for lameness relies on rapid treatment, yet there are no objective measures of lameness detection. Accelerometers and gyroscopes have been widely used in human activity studies and their use is becoming increasingly common in livestock. In this study, we used 23 datasets (10 non-lame and 13 lame sheep) from an accelerometer- and gyroscope-based ear sensor with a sampling frequency of 16 Hz to develop and compare algorithms that can differentiate lameness within three different activities (walking, standing and lying). We show for the first time that features extracted from accelerometer and gyroscope signals can differentiate between lame and non-lame sheep while standing, walking and lying. The random forest algorithm performed best for classifying lameness with an accuracy of 84.91% within lying, 81.15% within standing and 76.83% within walking and overall correctly classified over 80% sheep within activities. Both accelerometer- and gyroscope-based features ranked among the top 10 features for classification.

However, to improve the estimation of amino acid requirements for growing–finishing pigs, it is necessary to accurately estimate the real-time body protein (BP) mass. The aim of this study was to predict individual BP over time in order to obtain individual daily protein content of the gain (i.e., protein deposition/daily gain, PD/DG) to be integrated into a real-time model used for precision feeding. Two databases were used in this study: one for the development of the equations for the model and the other for model evaluation. For the equations, data from 79 barrows (25 to 144 kg BW) were used to estimate the parameters for a Gompertz function and a mixed linear-quadratic regression. Individual BP predictions obtained by dual X-ray absorptiometry were regressed as a function of BW. Individual pig BP estimates were obtained by linear-quadratic regression using the MIXED procedure of SAS, considering pig measurements repeated in time. Individual Gompertz curves were obtained using the NLMIXED procedure of SAS. Both procedures generate an average or a general model, which was assessed for accuracy with the database used to generate the equations. Coefficients of concordance and determination were both 0.99, and the RMSE was 0.21 kg for the linear-quadratic regression. The Gompertz curve coefficients of concordance and determination were both 0.99, and the RMSE was 0.36 kg. In sequence, the linear-quadratic regression and Gompertz curve were evaluated in an independent data set (488 observations; 21 to 126 kg BW). The linear-quadratic regression to predict BP mass was accurate (mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 2.5%; bias = 0.03); the Gompertz model performed worse (MAPE = 3.9%; bias = 0.04) than the linear-quadratic regression. When using the derivative of these equations to predict PD/DG, the linear-quadratic regression was more accurate (MAPE = 4.8%, bias = 0.17%) compared to the Gompertz (MAPE = 10.6%, bias = −0.99%) mainly due to the linear decrease in PD/DG in the observed data. Further analysis using individual pig data showed that the goodness of fit of PD/DG curve depends on the individual shape of the growth curve, with either the Gompertz or the linear-quadratic regression being more accurate for specific individuals. Therefore, both approaches are provided to allow end users to select the model that best fits their needs. The proposed update of the empirical component of the original model, using either linear-quadratic regression or the Gompertz function, is able to predict BP in real-time with good accuracy. © 2020 The Animal Consortium","growth composition; modelling; precision feeding; precision nutrition; protein deposition rates","agriculture; animal; animal food; diet; livestock; pig; statistical model; Agriculture; Animal Feed; Animals; Diet; Linear Models; Livestock; Swine"

In total, 13 pregnant cows and 12 cows with successful insemination were used in this study. Data were collected two weeks before and two weeks after delivery for calving. Similarly, data were collected two weeks before and two weeks after artificial insemination (AI) for estrus. Different cow variables were extracted from the raw data (e.g., lying time, number of steps, ruminating time, travelled distance) and used to build and test the detection models. Logistic regression models were developed for each individual sensor as well as for each combination of sensors (two or three) for both calving and estrus. Moreover, the detection performance within different time intervals (24 h, 12 h, 8 h, 4 h, and 2 h) before calving and AI was investigated. In general, for both calving and estrus, the performance of the detection within 2–4 h was lower than for 8 h-24 h. However, the use of a combination of sensors increased the performance for all investigated detection time intervals. For calving, similar results were obtained for the detection within 24 h, 12 h, and 8 h. When one sensor was used for calving detection within 24–8 h, the localization sensor performed best (Precision (Pr) 73–77%, Sensitivity (Se) 57–58%, Area under curve (AUC) 90–91%), followed by the leg-mounted accelerometer (Pr 67–77%, Se 54–55%, AUC = 88–90%) and the neck-mounted accelerometer (Pr 50–53%, Se 47–48%, AUC = 86–88%). As for calving, the results of estrus were similar for the time intervals 24 h-8 h. In this case, similar results were obtained when using any of the three sensors separately as when combining a neck- and a leg-mounted accelerometers (Pr 86–89%, Se 73–77%). For both calving and estrus, the performance improved when localization was combined with either the neck- or leg-mounted accelerometer, especially for the sensitivity (73–91%). Finally, for the detection with one sensor within a time interval of 4 h or 2 h, the Pr and Se decreased to 55–65% and 42–62% for estrus and to 40–63% and 33–40% for calving. However, the combination of localization with either leg or neck-mounted accelerometer as well as the combination of the three sensors improved the Pr and Se compared to one sensor (Pr 72–87%, Se 63–85%).

In order to provide an indication of the time when sows should be confined in crates, ear tag-based acceleration data was modeled to provide the following two types of alarms: A “first-stage“ alarm that indicates the beginning of nest-building behaviour, and a “second-stage“ alarm that indicates the ending of the nest-building behaviour. In total, 53 sows were included in the experiment. Each sow had an ear tag with an accelerometer sensor mounted on the ear. Acceleration data were modeled with the Kalman filtering and fixed interval smoothing (KALMSMO) algorithm. It was possible to predict farrowing on the basis of increased activity in the validation dataset with a median of 8 h 51 min before the onset of farrowing. Alarms that indicated the need for confinement of the sow in a crate were generated with a median of 2 h 3 min before the onset of farrowing.

Lameness is a common concern in group-housed systems. However, current methods are done manually by subjective methods, thus are difficult to complete. One alternative would be to automate the process by analyzing images generated by depth cameras. The present work aimed to develop and test a method for early detection of lameness in sows, adapting the kinematics method using top down depth cameras without the aid of reflective markers. Depth images were processed by dividing the animals into five body regions: head, left and right shoulders, and left and right hips. The centroid of each position was calculated, and their heights were recorded. Average, maximum, and minimum height at each of the five regions was calculated. The animal's velocity was also measured by calculating the Euclidian distance between positions of the animals' body centroid (not considering its head) over the time between frames. The curves of height by time obtained for the centroids of all five regions were plotted and analyzed. Time and length for each step was also computed. Preliminary results indicate lameness level was best correlated with number, time, and length of steps for each of four regions (left and right shoulders and left and right hips); total walk time; and number of local maxima for the head region.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a machine vision system that automatically counts the number of hens in battery cages. Automatically counting hens can help a regulatory agency or inspecting officer to estimate the number of living birds in a cage and, thus animal density, to ensure that they conform to government regulations or quality certification requirements. The test hen house was 87 m long, containing 37 battery cages stacked in 6-story high rows on both sides of the structure. Each cage housed 18 to 30 hens, for a total of approximately 11 000 laying hens. A feeder moves along the cages. A camera was installed on an arm connected to the feeder, which was specifically developed for this purpose. A wide-angle lens was used in order to frame an entire cage in the field of view. Detection and tracking algorithms were designed to detect hens in cages; the recorded videos were first processed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) object detection algorithm called Faster R-CNN, with an input of multi-angular view shifted images. After the initial detection, the hens’ relative location along the feeder was tracked and saved using a tracking algorithm. Information was added with every additional frame, as the camera arm moved along the cages. The algorithm count was compared with that made by a human observer (the ‘gold standard’). A validation dataset of about 2000 images achieved 89.6% accuracy at cage level, with a mean absolute error of 2.5 hens per cage. These results indicate that the model developed in this study is practicable for obtaining fairly good estimates of the number of laying hens in battery cages. © 2020 The Animal Consortium","deep learning; Faster R-CNN; object tracking; poultry; precision livestock farming","animal; animal housing; chicken; egg laying; Animals; Chickens; Housing, Animal; Oviposition"

Drastic cost reductions in sequencing and other omics technology have also facilitated the ability for deep phenotyping of livestock at the molecular level. These advances have brought the animal sciences to a cross-roads in data science where increased training is needed to manage, record, and analyze data to generate knowledge and advances in Agriscience related disciplines. This paper describes the opportunities and challenges in using high-throughput phenotyping, “big data,” analytics, and related technologies in the livestock industry based on discussions at the Livestock High-Throughput Phenotyping and Big Data Analytics meeting, held in November 2017 (see: https://www.animalgenome.org/bioinfo/community/workshops/2017/). Critical needs for investments in infrastructure for people (e.g., “big data” training), data (e.g., data transfer, management, and analytics), and technology (e.g., development of low cost sensors) were defined by this group. Though some subgroups of animal science have extensive experience in predictive modeling, cross-training in computer science, statistics, and related disciplines are needed to use big data for diverse applications in the field.

Literature gives insufficient anchor points to estimate the value of information (VOI) obtained with PLF technologies. This study proposes a conceptual framework with building blocks to determine the VOI. Next, the framework is used to describe factors and existing gaps in the VOI assessment. This, finally, leads to reflections and recommendations about how to assess and improve the VOI of PLF. Literature reveals that the VOI surpasses the mere use of more precise information to take decisions, but encompasses a path from data collection to decisions with particular outcomes. The framework interlinks three building blocks: (i) data processing, (ii) decision making and (iii) impact analysis with factors influencing the VOI such as the process to transform data into information, level of precision, decision rules, social influences, the accuracy of information, herd size and prevalence of the condition measured. Besides profitability, outcomes from decisions include the impact on animal welfare, environment, food safety, and food security. The data-to-value framework allows for a better assessment of VOI and its potentials, and provides anchor points to design useful and valuable PLF technologies. The framework also helps to determine the role of advisors in interpreting the more precise information and in formulating farmer-tailored advice to apply the most optimal practices.

The natural consequence of this is to drive the farmer and the animal further apart. However, closer attention to the animal not only positively impacts animal welfare and health but can also increase the capacity of the farmer to achieve a more sustainable production. State-of-the-art precision livestock farming (PLF) technology is one such means of bringing the animals closer to the farmer in the facing of expanding systems. Contrary to some current opinions, it can offer an alternative philosophy to 'farming by numbers'. This review addresses the key technology-oriented approaches to monitor animals and demonstrates how image and sound analyses can be used to build 'digital representations' of animals by giving an overview of some of the core concepts of PLF tool development and value discovery during PLF implementation. The key to developing such a representation is by measuring important behaviours and events in the livestock buildings. The application of image and sound can realise more advanced applications and has enormous potential in the industry. In the end, the importance lies in the accuracy of the developed PLF applications in the commercial farming system as this will also make the farmer embrace the technological development and ensure progress within the PLF field in favour of the livestock animals and their well-being. © The Animal Consortium 2019.","image analysis; livestock production; sound analysis; technology","agricultural land; agricultural worker; animal; animal husbandry; animal welfare; economics; human; livestock; organization and management; procedures; Animal Husbandry; Animal Welfare; Animals; Farmers; Farms; Humans; Livestock"

The objective of this study is to develop an effective un-supervised classification model of data collected by Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) attached to the back of dairy cows housed in free-stall. These data were aggregated according to different sampling frequencies and segmentation windows. The different times of lying, standing, lying down, standing up, walking and stationary behaviors were observed and recorded in real time. The designed classification model is based on univariate and multivariate Finite Mixture Models (FMM) and decision trees. The valid transitions between standing and lying behaviors are guaranteed by constraints imposed by a deterministic finite state automaton. The obtained results revealed that 99% of behaviors are well classified. Standing, lying on each side and changing between these positions are classified with 100% accuracy, followed by stationary with 99% sensitivity, 96% specificity, 99% precision and 99% accuracy. The walking behavior is classified with 96% sensitivity, 99% specificity, 91% precision and 98% accuracy.

A research gap exists regarding the impact of data-driven smart farming on the relationship between advisors and farmers, and advisors and farm data/technology. Therefore, we asked: how are farmers and advisors interacting with data-driven smart farming, and what are the implications for farm advisor capability and roles in a future where farmers use more data-driven smart farming? We studied advisory roles, advisor-farmer interactions, and new technologies in the context of three case studies: i) automated cow body condition scoring in New Zealand; ii) precision grazing management in New Zealand; and iii) the Soil Water Outlook tool in the Australian grains and lamb sectors. We propose a conceptual framework involving on-farm adaptation, learning, capability development and organizational roles. The findings show that smart technologies exhibit potentially disruptive features for farm management, necessitating greater input from a farmer's advisory network to facilitate optimal farm system adaptation. This has implications for the nature of the advisory relationship, where advisory capabilities evolve to include skills on determining technology value propositions alongside farmers and new skills are built for linking data to better decision-making on farm. This paper contributes to improved understanding of how back-office advisory roles may move from information gathering, to remote data interpretation due to data-driven smart farming. We identify the advisor's role in acting as a sensemaker in the smart farming innovation system, rather than a promoter or barrier to technology uptake. Further adaptation of advisory practices is required to enable greater value from data-driven smart farming to be captured by farmers. © 2019 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences","Advisors; Data-driven decisions; Smart farming; Social interaction; Trust","agricultural development; agricultural extension; agricultural technology; body condition; data interpretation; decision making; grazing management; livestock farming; social structure; soil water; technological development; New Zealand; Animalia"

This study aimed to develop and validate computer vision techniques to track required features of cattle face and to remotely assess eye temperature, ear-base temperature, respiration rate, and heart rate in cattle. Ten dairy cows were recorded during six handling procedures across two consecutive days using thermal infrared cameras and RGB (red, green, blue) video cameras. Simultaneously, core body temperature, respiration rate and heart rate were measured using more conventional ‘invasive’ methods to be compared with the data obtained with the proposed algorithms. The feature tracking algorithm, developed to improve image processing, showed an accuracy between 92% and 95% when tracking different areas of the face of cows. The results of this study also show correlation coefficients up to 0.99 between temperature measures obtained invasively and those obtained remotely, with the highest values achieved when the analysis was performed within individual cows. In the case of respiration rate, a positive correlation (r = 0.87) was found between visual observations and the analysis of non-radiometric infrared videos. Low to high correlation coefficients were found between the heart rates (0.09–0.99) obtained from attached monitors and from the proposed method. Furthermore, camera location and the area analysed appear to have a relevant impact on the performance of the proposed techniques. This study shows positive outcomes from the proposed computer vision techniques when measuring physiological parameters.

Body temperature (Tb) and heart rate (HR) could be used for early detection of diseases, stress or death. We tested physiological sensors in free-grazing Norwegian white sheep in Norway. Forty Tb sensors and thirty HR sensors were surgically implanted in 40 lambs and 10 ewes. Eight (27%) of the HR and eight (20%) of the Tb sensors were lost during the study period. Two Tb sensors migrated from the abdominal cavity in to the digestive system. ECG based validation of the HR sensors revealed a measurement error of 0.2 bpm (SD 5.2 bpm) and correct measurement quality was assigned in 90% of the measurements. Maximum and minimum HR confirmed by ECG was 197 bpm and 68 bpm respectively. Mean passive HR was 90 bpm (SD = 13 bpm) for ewes and 112 bpm (SD = 13 bpm) for lambs. Mean Tb for all animals was 39.6°C (range 36.9 to 41.8°C). Tb displayed 24-hour circadian rhythms during 80.7 % but HR only during 41.0 % of the studied period.

Its coefficients described ME used for total heat production (HP), growth (ADG), and egg mass (EM). A total of 480 Ross 308 hens were randomly and equally assigned to 2 treatments: precision feeding (PF) and conventional daily-restricted feeding (CON) from 23 to 34 wk of age. The PF system allowed birds to enter feeding stations voluntarily at any time, weighed them, and provided access to feed for 60 s if their BW was less than the breeder-recommended target BW. The CON birds were fed daily each morning. Energetic efficiency of hens was evaluated using residual feed intake (RFI), defined as the difference between observed and predicted ME intake (MEI). The energy partitioning model predicted (P &lt; 0.05): MEI = A × BW0.67 + 1.75 × ADG + 0.75 × EM + ɛ. The coefficient A, a vector of age-specific HP, was 142 kcal/kg0.67/d; the energy requirement for growth and EM was 1.75 and 0.75 kcal/g, respectively. For the CON and the PF hens, respectively, MEI was 366 and 354 kcal/d (P = 0.006); RFI was –5.9 and 6.7 kcal/d (P = 0.009); HP% was 85.5 and 87.7 (P &lt; 0.001); hen-day egg production (HDEP) was 65.5 and 55.2% (P &lt; 0.001). Although the CON hens had higher MEI, the model predicted lower HP%; thus, CON hens had more nutrients available for egg production, increased egg production, and were more energetically efficient than the PF hens. The decreased egg production by the PF hens was likely due to these hens receiving production-related feed increases after an egg was laid. However, feed allocation increases for the CON hens resulted in increasing MEI for all CON hens at the same time. Therefore, the PF hens had lower MEI and lower HDEP than the CON hens. © 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.","body composition; caloric restriction; maintenance requirements; meat-type chicken; precision livestock farming","agricultural worker; article; body composition; broiler; caloric restriction; controlled study; egg production; female; food intake; hen; human; nonhuman; nutrient; thermogenesis"

The results highlighted several advantages of F4SG applications in farm activities. The clear and fast readability of the information related to a single issue, combined with the large number of readings that SG performed, allowed F4SG adoption even in large farms.

However, it is well known that high concentrations of particulate matter causes health and welfare problems with livestock, farm workers and people living in the vicinity of the farm premises. In this work, a data-based mechanistic model is developed to relate broiler activity and ventilation rate with indoor particulate matter concentration. For six complete growing cycles, in a U.K. commercial poultry farm, broiler activity was monitored using a camera-based flock monitoring system (eYeNamic®) and ventilation rate was measured. Indoor particulate matter concentration was continuously monitored by measuring size-segregated mass fraction concentrations with the aerosol analyser DustTrak™. A discrete-time multi-input single-output time-invariant parameters Transfer Function model was developed to determine the particulate dynamics within each day of the growing cycle in the poultry house using broiler activity and ventilation rate as inputs. This model monitored indoor particulate matter concentration with an average accuracy of RT 2=(51±26)%. A dynamic linear regression modelling with time-variant parameters improved average accuracy with RT 2=(97.7±1.3)%. It forecasted one sample-ahead the indoor particulate matter concentration level, using a time window of 14 samples, with a mean relative prediction error, MRPE=(4.6±3.2)%. Thus, dynamic modelling with time-variant parameters has the potential to be part of a control system to manage in real-time indoor particulate matter concentration in broiler houses. © 2019","Climate control; Dust; Environmental quality; Forecasting; Precision livestock farming","Aerosols; Agriculture; Climate control; Dust; Forecasting; Houses; Quality control; Ventilation; Concentration levels; Environmental quality; Mechanistic modeling; Multi input single outputs; Particulate Matter; Precision livestock farming; Time-variant parameters; Transfer function model; Particles (particulate matter)"

This study presents a 3-dimensional surface fitting approach that provides a structure description of dairy cow's body for BCS estimation. a 3-dimensional algorithm that provides a topographical understanding of the cow's body to estimate BCS. In this study, the hypothesis tested was that the body contour of a fatter dairy cow is plumper than that of a thin dairy cow and, therefore, may better fit a paraboloid surface. Depth image processing and fitting model were investigated and consisted of three stages: (1) object location and separation of individual cow; (2) image surface fitting; and (3) parameters determination in body condition scoring (BCS) model. Compared with the previous studies, the novelty in this paper was completing the full-automation of a BCS system. The proposed model was trained and tested with the BCS value obtained manually.

However, previous studies on automatic BCS systems have used manual scoring for data collection, and traditional image extraction methods have limited model performance accuracy. In addition, the radio frequency identification device system commonly used in ranching has the disadvantages of misreadings and damage to bovine bodies. Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop and validate an automatic system for identifying individuals and assessing BCS using a deep learning framework. This work developed a linear regression model of BCS using ultrasound backfat thickness to determine BCS for training sets and tested a system based on convolutional neural networks with 3 channels, including depth, gray, and phase congruency, to analyze the back images of 686 cows. After we performed an analysis of image model performance, online verification was used to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the system. The results showed that the selected linear regression model had a high coefficient of determination value (0.976), and the correlation coefficient between manual BCS and ultrasonic BCS was 0.94. Although the overall accuracy of the BCS estimations was high (0.45, 0.77, and 0.98 within 0, 0.25, and 0.5 unit, respectively), the validation for actual BCS ranging from 3.25 to 3.5 was weak (the F1 scores were only 0.6 and 0.57, respectively, within the 0.25-unit range). Overall, individual identification and BCS assessment performed well in the online measurement, with accuracies of 0.937 and 0.409, respectively.

For this, precisely segmenting each cattle image from its background is a prerequisite, which is an important step towards obtaining real-time individual cattle information. In this paper, an instance segmentation approach based on a Mask R-CNN deep learning framework is proposed to solve cattle instance segmentation and contour extraction problems in a real feedlot environment. The proposed approach consists of the following steps: key frame extraction (detect the huge cattle motion frames), image enhancement (reduce the illumination and shadow influence), cattle segmentation and body contour extraction. We trained and tested the proposed approach on a challenging cattle image dataset. According to the experimental results, the proposed approach can render fairly desirable cattle segmentation performance with 0.92 Mean Pixel Accuracy (MPA) and achieve contour extraction with an Average Distance Error (ADE) of 33.56 pixel, which is better than that of the state-of-the-art SharpMask and DeepMask instance segmentation methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cattle contour; Deep learning; Instance segmentation; Mask R-CNN; Precision livestock farming","Agriculture; Deep learning; Extraction; Image enhancement; Pixels; Body condition score; Cattle contour; Key-frame extraction; Learning frameworks; Precision livestock farming; Segmentation methods; Segmentation performance; Vision-based approaches; Image segmentation; accuracy assessment; cattle; computer vision; data set; livestock farming; machine learning; performance assessment; pixel; precision; Bos"

More efficient use of precision technology has been identified as a potential way of addressing this problem. The mandatory requirement for Electronic Identification (EID) tags to be placed on all sheep offers an opportunity for sheep farmers to adopt precision technologies to manage herd health and maximise production and profit. Although the charactistics of farmers that are associated with adoption or non adoption of technology have been identified little is known about the social processes, meanings and experiences that influence uptake. This paper is novel as it draws on data from 36 sheep farmers in the UK and applies Normalization Process Theory (NPT) to gain an understanding of the reasons they do or do not use EID related precision technology on their farms. The interviews were tape recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using NVivo. Although respondents acknowledged the potential value of precision technology to improve their farm businesses they appeared to have alternative beliefs that were counter productive. Their beliefs that using precision technology posed a threat to their role as a good stockman, that it could not replace the need for hands-on interaction with their animals and that it was costly and difficult to use created an implementation gap. The use of NPT as an evaluation framework provided a valuable tool for increasing the understanding of contextual characteristics that undermine the routine embedding of such technology by sheep farmers. The data suggests that normalisation of the use of precision technology amongst sheep farmers could potentially be increased if manufacturers/suppliers co-design and work with farmer's to ensure that the technology enables the farmer to be in control and operates as an aid to achieving high quality stockmanship rather than a mechanism for profit maximisation. © 2019 The Authors","Attitudes; Decision making; Flock management; Normalisation Process Theory; Precsion livestock farming; Sheep; Social science","adoption; adult; agricultural land; agricultural worker; animal experiment; article; decision making; embedding; female; genetic transcription; interview; livestock; male; nonhuman; profit; sheep; sociology; agricultural worker; animal; animal husbandry; animal identification; attitude; devices; England; human; middle aged; psychology; sheep; technology; veterinary medicine; Wales; Adult; Animal Husbandry; Animal Identification Systems; Animals; Attitude; England; Farmers; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Sheep; Technology; Wales"

A 3D full-body scanning device was used to scan 64 lactating Holstein cows from March-June 2018. The cows were individually and automatically weighed at a static weighing station (mean ± standard deviation = 673 ± 65 kg). These measured weights were compared to those predicted from regression models based on volume, area or morphological traits determined from 177 3D images. Since some images were truncated due to cow movement or technical problems, we developed additional regression models to reconstruct total volume or area. The accuracy of volume and area measurements was first tested on an inert cylindrical form (coefficients of variation (CVs) &lt; 0.72%). The CVs for repeatability and reproducibility of the method of calculating volume and area from truncated images were 0.17% and 3.12%, respectively. Cow volume and area ranged from 0.61 to 0.96 m3 and 5.80 to 8.32 m2 respectively. Five regression models were developed to estimate cow body weight. Their coefficients of determination ranged from 0.82 to 0.93 with prediction errors of ca. 3% (20 kg) and 4% (29 kg) as a function of volume and area, respectively.

We investigated whether replacements at the feed bunk and water trough—one type of agonistic interaction—can be used to automatically assess dominance relationships. Our study set out to (1) validate a replacement detection algorithm using combined data from electronic feed and water bins, and (2) investigate the applicability of this algorithm to identify individual dominance scores and group-level social hierarchy in freestall-housed dairy cows. We used 4 groups of lactating cows kept in different group sizes (11 to 20 cows) located at 2 research facilities. In both facilities, feed and water were provided via automated feeding systems. A trained observer recorded all agonistic interactions in the pen over multiple days using video. Data from the electronic feed and water bins for the same days were analyzed using an algorithm to detect replacements (i.e., visits where a receiver cow was competitively replaced by an actor cow). Most agonistic interactions at the feed bunk were replacements. These replacements were associated with a brief interval between the time the receiver cow left the bin and the actor cow took her place; the optimal threshold to detect these replacements varied from 22 to 27 s between groups, independent of stocking density. The recall and precision of an algorithm based upon this threshold was high (on average >0.8), comparable to that of trained human observers. We improved data preparation by controlling for detection errors and included filtering to reduce false positives. This resulted in a >20% decrease in false positives and an increase in precision of 0.043. The dominance hierarchy based upon algorithm-detected replacements was similar to that based upon total agonistic interactions observed in the pen; the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between these hierarchies varied among the groups from 0.81 to 0.96. We conclude that data from electronic feed and water bins can accurately estimate agonistic behavior and dominance relationships among dairy cows. © 2019 American Dairy Science Association","precision livestock farming; social competition; welfare","agonistic behavior; animal; animal behavior; bovine; dairying; drinking; feeding behavior; female; lactation; psychology; social dominance; Agonistic Behavior; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cattle; Dairying; Drinking; Feeding Behavior; Female; Lactation; Social Dominance"

The study characteristics extracted from 264 peer-reviewed publications and conference proceedings suggest that poultry PLF has received increasing attention on a global scale, but is yet to become a widespread commercial reality. PLF development has most commonly focussed on broiler farming, followed by laying hens, and mainly involves the use of sensors (environmental and wearable) and cameras. More publications had animal health and welfare than production as either one of or the only goal, suggesting that PLF development so far has focussed on improving animal health and welfare.

This study monitored the behaviors of sows and piglets in a commercial setting utilizing an autonomous machine vision system. The objectives of this research were to: (1) implement a digital and time-of-flight depth imaging system, (2) develop a process with minimal user input to analyze the collected images, and (3) calculate the hourly and daily posture and behavior budgets of sows housed in individual farrowing stalls. Depth sensors were centered above each stall in three farrowing rooms (20 sows per room) and controlled by mini-PCs, acquiring images continuously at 0.2 FPS. Data files were transmitted via Ethernet cable to a switch, then to a 50 TB disk station for storage. Recorded image data were subsequently analyzed to quantify sow posture budgets and behaviors using a computer processing algorithm. Algorithm classifications were compared to those of trained human labelers with sow posture classified correctly >99.2% (sitting: 99.4%, standing: 99.2%, kneeling: 99.7%, lying: 99.9%). Specificity and sensitivity parameters for posture classifications were >84.6%, with the exception of lower specificity for kneeling (20.5%). When lying, direction (sow lying on left or right side of body) was classified with an accuracy of 96.2%. Sows that were not lying were also labeled with a behavior, including feeding (97.0% accuracy), drinking behavior (96.8% accuracy), and other behavior (95.5% accuracy). Each non-lying behavior label had specificity >88.3% and sensitivity >77.4%.

There are few examples of automated livestock vocalisation classification algorithms, and we have found none capable of being easily adapted and applied to different species’ vocalisations. In this work, a multi-purpose livestock vocalisation classification algorithm is presented, utilising audio-specific feature extraction techniques, and machine learning models. To test the multi-purpose nature of the algorithm, three separate data sets were created targeting livestock-related vocalisations, namely sheep, cattle, and Maremma sheepdogs. Audio data was extracted from continuous recordings conducted on-site at three different operational farming enterprises, reflecting the conditions of real deployment. A comparison of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and Discrete Wavelet Transform-based (DWT) features was conducted. Classification was determined using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. High accuracy was achieved for all data sets (sheep: 99.29%, cattle: 95.78%, dogs: 99.67%). Classification performance alone was insufficient to determine the most suitable feature extraction method for each data set. Computational timing results revealed the DWT-based features to be markedly faster to produce (14.81 – 15.38% decrease in execution time).

This study focussed on the development of an algorithm to monitor chicken sneezing sounds in a situation where multiple birds are active and multiple noise sources are present. An experiment was designed where the sneezing from within a group of 51 chickens was recorded. 763 sneezes were annotated out of 480 min of sound recordings. First, the number of labelled sneezes of adequate quality were investigated. Then raw sound signal was filtered using spectral subtraction and split into short intervals with elevated energy that could be sneezes. This led to a highly unbalanced dataset containing only 0.24% sneezes, from which features characterising the sneezing sounds were calculated. These were then grouped into 8 different features on which the algorithm classified the sound as sneeze or no-sneeze with a sensitivity of 66.7% and a precision of 88.4%.

Continuous and automatic monitoring of growth of individual finishing pigs is an essential element of a precision feeding system. For optimal pig growth, the feed nutrients need to be adjusted at different moments in time throughout the fattening period. In an integrated system, the key element is the prediction of the process output (weight) to a variation of the process input (feed supply). During the course of this study, three experiments were performed, with 80 pigs on average in each of them, to measure and model their growth responses to step changes in feed amount and/or feed composition along the production cycle. The individual dynamic responses of pig growth to feed changes are monitored by gathering daily weight and feed supply data for each individual pig. The time-series data is analysed using Transfer Function (TF) and Dynamic Linear Regression (DLR) models. On one hand, the average TF model fitting agreement is (RT 2=94 ± 4)%. On the other hand, the Mean Relative Prediction Error (MRPE) of applying the DLR approach with a window size of four and seven days was found to be, MRPE = (1.0 ± 0.4)%, and MRPE = (3.3 ± 1.3)% for a forecasting horizon of one and seven days, respectively. Moreover, a parameter of the DLR model resembles the feed efficiency of the pig, exhibiting a coefficient of correlation, r = (0.9 ± 0.2). While the current models may need further validation, the approach seems promising to be implemented in an individual integrated pig feeding system. © 2019","Dynamic model; Feed efficiency; Precision livestock farming; Swine","Agriculture; Dynamic models; Efficiency; Feeding; Forecasting; Materials handling equipment; Automatic monitoring; Essential elements; Feed efficiencies; Genetic potential; Individual dynamics; Integrated systems; Precision livestock farming; Swine; Mammals; Animalia; Suidae"

One strategy could be to predict events of tail biting so that the farmer can make timely interventions in specific pens. In the current investigation, sensor data on water usage (water flow and activation frequency) and pen temperature (above solid and slatted floor) were included in the development of a prediction algorithm for tail biting. Steps in the development included modelling of data sources with dynamic linear models, optimisation and training of artificial neural networks and combining predictions of the single data sources with a Bayesian ensemble strategy. Lastly, the Bayesian ensemble combination was tested on a separate batch of finisher pigs in a real-life setting. The final prediction algorithm had an AUC > 0.80, and thus it does seem possible to predict events of tail biting from already available sensor data. However, around 30% of the no-event days were false alarms, and more event-specific predictors are needed. Thus, it was suggested that farmers could use the alarms to point out pens that need greater attention. © 2019 by the authors.

These methods are already used to automatically classify animal vocalizations, for example, in identifying animal species and estimating numbers of individuals. Despite this potential, they have not yet found widespread application in animal welfare monitoring. In this review, we first discuss current trends in sound analysis for ecology, conservation and sound classification. Following this, we detail the vocalizations produced by three of the most important farm livestock species: chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and cattle (Bos taurus).

However, much less is known about the aetiology of EB behaviour compared to tail biting behaviour. Application of new intervention strategies may be the key to deal with this welfare issue. The discipline of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF)allows farmers to improve their management practices with the use of advanced technologies. Exploring the behaviour is the first step to identify reliable indicators for the development of such a tool. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an ethogram of biter and bitten pigs during an EB event and to find potential features for the development of a tool that can monitor EB events automatically and continuously. The observational study was carried out on a 300 sow farrow-to-finish commercial farm in Ireland (Co. Cork)during the first and second weaner stages. Three pens per stage holding c. 35 pigs each, six pens in total, were video recorded and 2.2 h of videos per pen were selected for video analysis. Two ethograms were developed, one for the biter and one for the bitten pig, to describe their behavioural repertoire. Behaviours were audio-visually labelled using ELAN and afterwards the resulting labels were processed using MATLAB® 2014. For the video data, duration and frequency of the observed behavioural interactions were quantified. Six behaviours were identified for the biter pig and a total of 710 interactions were observed: chewing (215 cases), quick bite (138 cases), pulling ear (97 cases), shaking head (11 cases), gentle manipulation (129 cases)and attempt to EB (93 cases). When the behaviour observed was not certain, it was classified as doubt (27 cases). Seven behaviours were identified for the bitten pig in response to the biters behaviour and were divided in: four non-vocal behaviours described as biting (40 cases), head knocking (209 cases), shaking/moving head (225 cases)or moving away (156 cases); and three vocal behaviours identified as scream (74 cases), grunt (166 cases), and squeal (125 cases). Vocal behaviours were classified using a verified set of features yielding a precision of 83.2%. A significant difference in duration was found between all the behaviours (P < 0.001), except between gentle manipulation and chewing where no difference in duration was found (P < 0.338). The results illustrate the heterogeneity of EB behaviours, which may be used to better understand this poorly studied damaging behaviour. They also indicate potential for the development of a PLF tool to automatically, continuously monitor such behaviour on farm by combining the behaviour of the biter pig and the bitten pigs responses. © 2019 The Authors","Bioacoustics; Damaging behaviour; Ear biting; Labelling; Pig; Vocalisations","animal welfare; behavioral ecology; bioacoustics; biological development; ecolabeling; etiology; exploration; intensive agriculture; livestock farming; management practice; pig; precision agriculture; videography; vocalization; Ireland; Suidae"

For large scale applications, accurate and inexpensive methane predictors are required. Within a livestock precision farming context, the objective of this work was to integrate real-time data on animal feeding behaviour with an in silico model for predicting the individual dynamic pattern of methane emission in cattle. The integration of real-time data with a mathematical model to predict variables that are not directly measured constitutes a software sensor. We developed a dynamic parsimonious grey-box model that uses as predictor variables either dry matter intake (DMI) or the intake time (IT). The model is described by ordinary differential equations. Model building was supported by experimental data of methane emissions from respiration chambers. The data set comes from a study with finishing beef steers (cross-bred Charolais and purebred Luing finishing). Dry matter intake and IT were recorded using feed bins. For research purposes, in this work, our software sensor operated off-line. That is, the predictor variables (DMI, IT) were extracted from the recorded data (rather than from an on-line sensor). A total of 37 individual dynamic patterns of methane production were analyzed. Model performance was assessed by concordance analysis between the predicted methane output and the methane measured in respiration chambers. The model predictors DMI and IT performed similarly with a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.78 on average. When predicting the daily methane production, the CCC was 0.99 for both DMI and IT predictors. Consequently, on the basis of concordance analysis, our model performs very well compared with reported literature results for methane proxies and predictive models. As IT measurements are easier to obtain than DMI measurements, this study suggests that a software sensor that integrates our in silico model with a real-time sensor providing accurate IT measurements is a viable solution for predicting methane output in a large scale context. © The Animal Consortium 2018.","greenhouse gas; methane; modelling; precision farming; ruminant","methane; analysis; animal; animal food; biological model; biosynthesis; bovine; computer simulation; diet; feeding behavior; male; software; veterinary medicine; Animal Feed; Animals; Cattle; Computer Simulation; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Male; Methane; Models, Biological; Software"

Hence, it is in the interest of livestock farmers to have information on approaching calving events to ensure a sound birth, health and welfare of the dairy cow and calf for profitable and sustainable milk production. Changes in the ingestive behavior of dairy cows due to the onset of calving have been revealed in several studies. Therefore, sensor data of these behaviors may be useful for automated prediction of calving time. The current study used sensor data of a novel monitoring device for ingestive behavior (RumiWatch noseband sensor, Agroscope, Ettenhausen, Switzerland and Itin+Hoch GmbH, Liestal, Switzerland) of 35 dairy cows for development and validation of a predictive model for calving time. Sensor data obtained from calving events on three farms were used as one training dataset and two independent validation datasets to evaluate the predictive performance of a Naïve Bayes classifier model for calving prediction at 1 h before the start of calving. The model performance was evaluated on an hourly basis for 168 h prior to the start of calving. Combined sensor variables with highest predictive performance were ruminating chews, ruminating boluses, and eating chews (sensitivity = 0.82, specificity = 0.87, positive predictive value = 0.04) in Validation Dataset 1, and ruminating chews per bolus, ruminating chews per minute, eating chews, other activity time, other chews (sensitivity = 0.69, specificity = 0.86, positive predictive value = 0.03) in Validation Dataset 2. These results indicate, that the sensitivity and specificity of the predictive model were satisfying, but the positive predictive value was low and the amount of false positive alerts was considerably high. Although the developed model is therefore not suitable for application in practice, we found that particularly variables of rumination behavior have predictive value and should be taken into consideration for future research on calving detection models. The findings of this study demonstrate that an assessment limited to the terms of sensitivity and specificity may be misleading, as these variables may achieve high values and suggest adequate performance, while the model is not appropriate in the light of its expected use. © 2018 The Authors","Animal monitoring; Naïve Bayes classifier; Precision dairy farming; RumiWatch; Transition cow","Agriculture; Classification (of information); Bayes Classifier; Dairy farming; Positive predictive values; Predictive performance; RumiWatch; Sensitivity and specificity; Sensor measurements; Transition cow; Dairies; cattle; dairy farming; measurement method; milk production; model; model validation; monitoring system; sensor; Switzerland; Animalia"

Nowadays, animal tracking solutions based on global positioning systems (GPS) are commercially available. However, existing devices have several constraints, mostly related to wireless data transmission and financial cost, which make impractical the monitorization of all the animals in a herd. The main objective of this work is to develop a low-cost solution to enable the monitorization of a whole herd. An IoT-based system, which requires some animals of the herd being fitted with GPS collars connected to a Sigfox network and the rest with low-cost Bluetooth tags, has been developed. Its performance has been tested in two commercial farms, raising sheep and beef cattle, through the monitorization of 50 females in each case. Several collar/tag ratios, which define the cost per animal of the solution, have been simulated. Results demonstrate that a low collar/tag ratio enable the monitorization of a whole sheep herd. A larger ratio is needed for beef cows because of their grazing behavior. Nevertheless, the optimal ratio depends on the purpose of location data. Large variability has been observed for the number of hourly and daily messages from collars and tags. The system effectiveness for the monitorization of all the animals in a herd has been certainly proved. © 2019 by the authors.

In contrast to traditional approaches that use basic image processing techniques, the proposed algorithm focuses on particular appearance features of pigs and employs the template matching framework to facilitate pig detection. First, to capture the key appearance characteristics of pigs in templates, we represent images as the combination of two complementary descriptors, i.e., dominant orientation templates (DOTs) and brightness ratio templates (BRTs). A DOT establishes relationships with edge features, while a BRT encodes intensity and texture features. Both descriptors are given in binary form to increase the time efficiency of the algorithm. Then, representative pig templates can be obtained from training images through an automatic selection process based on template clustering. Finally, the input image is scanned to compute matching responses for all templates. Thus, objects having similar visual properties as the given templates are considered as detected pigs. Experiments are conducted on the test data extracted from a surveillance video covering 5 days. The experimental results show that our algorithm achieves an average detection rate of 86.8% with a low false alarm rate, which outperforms methods based on threshold segmentation. As a result, the proposed method can effectively and reliably extract pigs in complex scenes including multiple sources of disturbances such as uneven illumination, foreground objects of varying colour, pigs moving slowly, etc. © 2019 IAgrE","Computer vision; Group-housed pigs; Pig detection; Precision livestock farming","Agriculture; Computer vision; Feature extraction; Image segmentation; Mammals; Monitoring; Security systems; Textures; Automatic selection; Dominant orientation; Group-housed pigs; Image processing technique; Precision livestock farming; Threshold segmentation; Traditional approaches; Uneven illuminations; Template matching"

Consequently, large numbers of cattle are not meeting target specification at the abattoir. Video imaging analysis (VIA) is increasingly used in abattoirs to grade carcasses with high accuracy. There is potential for three-dimensional (3D) imaging to be used on farm to predict carcass characteristics of live animals and to optimise slaughter selections. The objectives of this study were to predict liveweight (LW) and carcass characteristics of live animals using 3D imaging technology and machine learning algorithms (artificial neural networks). Three dimensional images and LW's were passively collected from finishing steer and heifer beef cattle of a variety of breeds pre-slaughter (either on farm or after entry to the abattoir lairage) using an automated camera system. Sixty potential predictor variables were automatically extracted from the live animal 3D images using bespoke algorithms; these variables included lengths, heights, widths, areas, volumes, and ratios and were used to develop predictive models for liveweight and carcass characteristics. Cold carcass weights (CCW) for each animal were provided by the abattoir. Saleable meat yield (SMY) and EUROP fat and conformation grades were also determined for each individual by VIA of half of the carcass. Performance of prediction models was assessed using R2 and RMSE parameters following regression of predicted and actual variables for LW (R2 = 0.7, RMSE = 42), CCW (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 14) and SMY (R2 = 0.72, RMSE = 14). The models predicted EUROP fat and conformation grades with 54 and 55% accuracy (R2), respectively. This study demonstrated that 3D imaging coupled with machine learning analytics can be used to predict LW, SMY and traditional carcass characteristics of live animals.

Recent research suggests that removal of known risk factors may not be enough to eliminate tail biting, especially in undocked pigs, thus a different strategy is worth investigating. This could be early detection of tail biting, using behavioural changes observed before tail damage. If these early stages of tail biting can be detected before tail damage occurs, then tail damage could be prevented by early interventions. The first step in developing such a strategy is to identify the types of behaviour changes that emerge during early stages of tail biting. Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate whether pen level activity and object manipulation evolved differently during the last 7 days before the scoring of tail damage (day 0) for pens scored with tail damage (tail damage pens) and pens not scored with tail damage (matched control pens). The study included video recordings for twenty-four tail damage pens and thirty-two matched control pens. Activity level and object manipulation were observed the last 7 days before day 0 during the morning (0600 to 0800 h), afternoon (1600 to 1800 h) and evening (2200 to 2400 h, only activity level). Both activity level and object manipulation were analysed using generalised linear mixed effects models with a binomial distribution for activity level and a negative binomial distribution for object manipulation. The probability of being active was higher in tail damage pens compared to control pens during the afternoon the last 5 days before day 0 (P<0.001). This was seen due to a decrease in activity level in the control pens, which makes it difficult to identify future tail damage pens from this difference. Object manipulation was lower in tail damage pens compared to the control pens on all 7 days before day 0, but only in pens with undocked pigs (P<0.01). Thus, it is still unknown when this difference in object manipulation initiated. It was concluded that both activity level and object manipulation seemed related to ongoing tail biting and should be investigated through more detailed observations and for a longer time to establish the normal behaviour pattern for a particular pen. Thus, it is suggested that future research focusses on developing automatic monitoring methods for pen level activity and object manipulation and applies algorithms that establish and detect deviations from the normal behaviour pattern of the pen before tail damage. © The Animal Consortium 2018.","Activity level; Behavioural changes; Manipulative behaviour; Pig production; Precision livestock farming","algorithm; animal; animal behavior; animal husbandry; animal welfare; bites and stings; injuries; pig; procedures; risk factor; tail; veterinary medicine; videorecording; Algorithms; Animal Husbandry; Animal Welfare; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Bites and Stings; Risk Factors; Swine; Tail; Video Recording"

The objectives of the current study were to (i) build and test a custom hoof weigh crate (HWC) to measure the individual hoof load of sheep, (ii) quantify the relationship between hoof health status and the load a sheep distributes to each hoof, and (iii) evaluate the ability of the HWC to differentiate healthy from infected hooves. The overall footprint of the HWC was 950 mm × 450 mm, wherein two strain-gauge load cells were placed underneath each of four individual hoof platforms. An experiment was conducted over nine non-consecutive days between July and October 2017. On each experimental day, a total of 20 ewes (consisting of lame and healthy ewes) were placed on the HWC for five-minutes each. Each sheep hoof was visually assessed for lesions by three independent operators and a hoof lesion score assigned (scale from 0- healthy to 4-severe footrot). In addition to individual hoof load, the load placed on each hoof was divided by the sum of the load of the respective contralateral pair (front or back hooves), and multiplied by 100 to express the contralateral load percentage. A linear mixed model was invoked for each of the two load parameters as the dependent variable while hoof lesion score, contralateral pair, and their interaction were included as fixed effects. Each hoof was classified into a hoof lesion score category based on its load parameter values, and the numbers of correct and incorrect classifications were quantified. Healthy front hooves naturally carried more weight (60% of total weight) in comparison to healthy back hooves (40% of total weight), but when front or back hooves were infected to the same extent, they carried the same load. Results from the linear mixed model showed a small mean difference (4.5 kg) in hoof load between healthy front hooves and those with a mild infection (i.e., score = 1), but there was no hoof load difference between healthy back hooves and those with a mild infection (P < 0.05). The lowest proportion of misclassified hooves (sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 95%) was observed when the contralateral load percentage was used to differentiate between healthy hooves and those with extensive inter-digital dermatitis. Results herein indicate that the HWC could be used to automatically detect extensive infection in sheep hooves. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Precision livestock farming; Static load cells; Weight distribution","Strain gages; Weighing; Dependent variables; Lameness detection; Linear mixed models; Load percentage; Precision livestock farming; Routine inspection; Static loads; Weight distributions; Agriculture; detection method; experiment; health status; livestock farming; model; morbidity; numerical method; precision agriculture; sheep; Ovis aries"

Early indicators of medical problems, which use sensors to alert cattle farmers early concerning individual animals that need special care, are proliferating. Wearable technologies dominate the market. In less-value-per-animal systems like sheep, goat, pig, poultry, and fish, one sensor, like a camera or robot per herd/flock/school, rather than one sensor per animal, will become common. PLF sensors generate huge amounts of data, and many actors benefit from PLF data. No standards currently exist for sharing sensor-generated data, limiting the use of commercial sensors. Technologies providing accurate data can enhance a well-managed farm. Development of methods to turn the data into actionable solutions is critical. Copyright © 2019 by Annual Reviews.

Feed intake and feed efficiency have a significant economic value for the farmer. A common method for measuring feed mass in research is a feed mass weighing system, which is excessively expensive for commercial farms. However, feed mass can be estimated by its volume, which can be measured by photogrammetry. Photogrammetry applies cameras along the feed-lane, photographing the feed before and after the cow visits the feed-lane, and calculating the feed volume. In this study, the precision of estimating feed mass by its volume was tested by comparing measured mass and calculated volume of feed heaps. The following principal factors had an impact on the precision of this method: Camera quality, lighting conditions, image resolution, number of images, and feed density. Under laboratory conditions, the feed mass estimation error was 0·483 kg for heaps up to 7 kg, while in the cowshed the estimation error was 1·32 kg for up to 40 kg. A complementary experiment showed that the natural feed compressibility causes about 85% of uncertainty in the mass estimation error. © 2019 Hannah Dairy Research Foundation.","cow feed mass estimation; Dairy cow; feed compressibility; individual cow feed intake; photogrammetry; precision livestock farming","analysis; animal; animal food; bovine; dairying; devices; eating; economics; female; photogrammetry; physiologic monitoring; physiology; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; statistics and numerical data; veterinary medicine; Animal Feed; Animals; Cattle; Dairying; Eating; Female; Monitoring, Physiologic; Photogrammetry; Sensitivity and Specificity"

A main objective of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) is to deliver a tool for active mangement of livestock to improve animal welfare and health and to make livestock farming more animal economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. The importance of well managed animal welfare is not limited to the ethical viewpoint but is also crucial to realise a more efficient process to produce animal products. When considering the metabolic energy balance in a homeothermic living organism, there are different components: basal metabolism, the thermal component, the physical component related to movement or delivering power, the production term (meat, milk, eggs) and finally the mental component. When applying the stress monitoring, developed for humans, on animals we see that we can monitor frustration of horses in real-time.

Furthermore, adopting PLF to support management strategies may lead to the reduction of the environmental impact of farms. To date, the environmental impact of livestock farming can be mitigated by the adoption of several practices, such as technical improvements (manure treatments, intensification, management strategies) and/ or dietary changes. Although PLF is not yet designed to directly reduce the environmental impact of livestock farming, several authors claim that it is possible. The great potential of PLF relies on early warnings, that give the farmer the possibility to take action as soon as the first signals of impaired welfare or health appear. As an example, the use of real time technology (sensors, microphone and preventive diagnostic tools) has the potential to improve animal welfare, increase the performance, and minimise the environmental footprint. Indeed, improving animal health and reducing animal morbidity and mortality have the potential to increase the saleable output, and dilute non-CO2 emissions per unit product, and could represent an effective strategy to limit the use of antibiotics. Good productive performance that relies on animal health and welfare achieved through PLF can mitigate the environmental impact of livestock. More studies are necessary to extend the actual potential of PLF as a mitigation strategy. Undeniably, if this potential is confirmed, PLF could enter among the BATs. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

There are unrealised potential benefits of making on farm data interoperable and accessible and federating it with public data sources. We reviewed recent literature on precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies in relation to the use of public data, open standards and interoperability. Livestock farms produce rising volumes of disparate private datasets, reflecting a variety of information needs and technological opportunities, but typically lacking interoperable formats and metadata. These as well as large amounts of accessible public datasets are currently underutilised in decision support tools. Tools that demonstrate the use of interoperable standards and bring together public and private data for decision support can enhance the value proposition and help lower barriers to the sharing and re-use of data. This review of interoperable standards in extensive livestock farming systems concludes that there is a need for not only a new type of decision support tool, but also a consensus on data exchange standards to prove the value of shared data at farm scale (commercial benefit) and a regional scale (public good). © 2018","Data standards; Decision support; Interoperability; Precision livestock farming","Decision support systems; Electronic data interchange; Interoperability; Data Exchange Standard; Data interoperability; Data standards; Decision support tools; Decision supports; Precision livestock farming; Public data source; Technological opportunity; Agriculture; agricultural technology; biomonitoring; data set; decision support system; farming system; literature review; livestock farming; precision agriculture; standard (reference); Animalia"

These concerns can be addressed by academic and applied research into animal welfare and health indicators and increasingly by the utilisation of welfare and health metrics in operational farm management systems. TrackLab 2 is the latest tool for the measurement of livestock welfare and health indicators. It is designed to integrate and process multi-modal data for the capture of welfare and health indicators such as social behaviour, place-preference, activity, feeding and physiology. It was beta tested on four sites in the dairy cattle, poultry and pig farming domain. These first explorative tests revealed that TrackLab metrics are useful for both scientific, applied and commercial livestock research. TrackLab hardware is working well for large animals (cows, calves, pigs, sheep, poultry) but needs to be optimised for use on young birds and piglets. TrackLab 2 is also the first version to be applied in the operational farming context.

This paper aims to form a discussion around the proposal of an automatic cattle monitoring system which uses camera technology to identify important attributes relating to animal health and farm management at a herd level as well as at the level of the individual animal. Such a system will allow the farmer's eyes and ears to be replaced wherever a camera can be placed sufficiently close to monitor individual animals. The system aims to have the capability to recognise cow features from her visual appearance alone which allows for more independent operation and more flexible installation requirements. The system should operate in real-time and be sensitive to the smallest deviations in appearance. This means the farmer can be promptly alerted to potential health issues enabling quicker remedy. The accurate measurement of individual cow nutritional requirements has huge potential when coupled with precise, labour-saving automatic concentrate feeding systems and parlour systems. It opens the possibility for the relationship between feed nutrients and the attributes measured by the system to be discovered for each individual cow. This results in more efficient use of concentrates exactly in accordance with the cow's needs.

In our study we provide data providers within the livestock farming industry with guidelines to describe their data sets more accurately and provide model developers useful techniques to compose a good quality subset of the data to form the base for their model development.

This work proposes an integrated bioeconomic modelling to highlight the need for holistic approaches for PFL technology evaluation. We developed a biological model of dairy herd dynamics that simulated herd population, cow reproduction, milk production and health on the basis of cow-week events. The cow-week occurrence of diseases was based on basic incidences, cow specific risk factors and herd contamination risks. The health disorders affect milk production, mortality risk, food needs and reproduction performances. This biological model was combined with an economic optimisation model which dynamically represents farmer's input allocation decisions while maximising his utility under constraints (welfare, antimicrobial use, cash flow and working time…). The results show the added value provided by the holistic modelling approach of the biologic and economic processes. Three key characteristics of the model are highlighted: it (i) allows a broad range of possible solutions (no a priori), (ii) offers a good equilibrium and ponderation within the precision level of the modelling and (iii) has a real optimisation tool for the economic modelling. Many models used up to now do not fulfill these criteria, and biased conclusions may result from these models. This issue is the most challenging for PLF since the questions raised are very specific and focused. For precision livestock farming, this kind of approach gathering high level of resolution in the modelling process and holistic system approach may be of interest (i) for the algorithm itself as a tool to help decision making and event prediction, and (ii) for the economic evaluation of PFL new technology (cost and added value of the new technology output). © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Calving prediction is key for preventing fatal accidents such as stillbirth and dystocia. Such a prediction has been performed using contact sensors to capture a cow's typical movements before calving. However, directly attaching sensors to a cow's body is not desirable from the viewpoint of animal welfare, economic load, and safety for livestock farmers. This paper presents a camera-based, noncontact calving prediction system that captures typical precalving movements such as rotations, turns and step-backs. The information on the frequency of such behaviours and that on the frequency of changes in the behaviours are extracted every few minutes using deep neural networks and used as inputs to a calving predictor based on support vector machines.

Extensive systems have significant and challenging welfare risks, very different from intensive systems. Predation, weather, food and water deprivation, internal and external parasites can all impact on these systems, with the animals very self-dependent. Inspection opportunities are very different. Welfare codes and supporting legal obligations are adapted to extensive and difficult environments and often have vague recommendations for inspection frequency. There are clear opportunities for PLF technologies, notably wearables, to provide more information to stockpeople, improving welfare and reducing risk. Communications from animal to stockpeople via GSM or LPWAN enables real-time monitoring (RTM) for illness, such as lameness (with IMU), for mis-mothering (with proximity), for straying away from preferred areas and/or into dangerous areas (with location technology such as GNSS), for predation/worrying from wild animals/domestic dogs (with GNSS and/or IMU). These can signify need for action or assurance for no action. However, wearables have welfare risks. Research-user experiences confirm direct welfare risks through physical damage from equipment. With infrequent inspection, small issues can become larger. There are additional animal energy demands of heavier wearables. The conservation science community note impacts of wearables for survival and reproductive success. Good design and low weight are critical issues for commercialisation. False-positive alerts and reports could involve considerable wasted time by stockpeople and new value judgements may be needed. Without RTM-based PLF, the animal could face welfare challenges or be in a poor welfare state, about which the stockperson has no knowledge, and with infrequent inspections, this state may continue or worsen. With RTM based PLF, then the stockperson should know and logically has a changed duty of care and responsibility to act upon this information. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Precision Livestock Farming tools can concretely help the farmer to monitor the behaviour of each individual animal in the barn. In order to implement these techniques, it is however necessary to define the relationships between cow behaviour and environmental parameters like temperature humidity index (THI). The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of climatic conditions (temperature and relative humidity) on the behaviour of a group of primiparous dairy cows. Behavioural activities of all cows in the group were monitored by continuous video recording for 296 days (from September to July). To assess the effects of THI on the behaviours logistic regression analysis has been applied. Results confirmed that THI can affect behavioural indices. The average daily lying index varied from 54% in winter to 43% in summer despite in the latter period THI values were much lower than the heat stress threshold (average THI: 74). The statistical approach adopted in this study, after a validation process through the use of accelerometers, could be the starting point for the development of predictive models. The use of this kind of tool, may offer a valid support to the farmer to monitor cow behaviours and to adopt mitigation measures in case of heat stress. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Earlier systems developed were either costly or unreliable enough for commercial farms. This research developed a low-cost individual feed intake system using RGB-D cameras and deep learning algorithm. Depth and colour images are produced from an RGB-D camera, and are used to build a CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) regression model for weight intake prediction. To provide training data, an automatic data acquisition system was designed to collect a wide range of food weights, in different configurations and conditions (indoor, outdoor, direct-sun). The system included a scale and a micro-controller set in the Volcani research dairy facility, an open cowshed with Holstein cows, eating Total Mix Ration. With this setup, 28,761 data were collected over seven days. Additional data were created by data augmentation methods. The model was evaluated on a test-dataset acquired in the same dairy farm. The model was tested for different combinations of training data (direct-sun/outdoor) to evaluate the importance of the data diversity. Per meal, mean absolute and square errors were 0.127 kg, and 0.034 kg2, respectively, the consumed amount of feed measured in range of 0-8 kg. The sensitivity analysis shows that the amount and diversity of data is important for model training. Better results were achieved for the model that was trained with high diversity data. The results suggest that cameras and CNNs are feasible for individual feed intake measurement on the dairy farm. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

This analysis provides some theoretical limits and ranking of precision milking management strategies to improve the capital efficiency of AMS technology. The strategies identified in this analysis were: 1) Increasing the fraction of the day that the AMS box is occupied for milking; 2) Setting a minimum projected milk yield for milking permission; 3) Milking the slowest quarter faster; and 4) Reducing udder prep and attach time. Other substantial value-added propositions for AMS management are to improve the economics of feeding using cow level concentrate feeding and the use of economic models to identify less profitable cows as candidates for dry-off and culling. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

This was tested by comparing variables describing sensor data patterns (“curve-parameters”) from resilient or FE cows with non-resilient or non-FE cows. Sensor data included data from weighing scales, activity (steps) and rumination activity from neck collars, and milk production from the parlour or the milking robot. Curve-parameters were calculated for each sensor for each lactation for which data was available and included the mean, standard deviation (std), slope, skewness, and the autocorrelation. Data originated from a Wageningen Research farm, and included data from 1,800 cows with calvings between 1995-2016. During this time frame, there were 98 lactations with sufficient feed intake recordings to compute FE at lactation level (DMI (kg) / milk yield (kg)), and to rank them accordingly. The 1,800 cows that could be ranked according to their lifetime resilience (ability to re-calf in combination with the number of health and insemination events) based on scores for each of the, in total, 5,771 lactations. Subsequently, the 20% or 10% most and least FE or resilient lactations, respectively, were selected. Curve-parameters of these selected lactations were compared. Results imply that using a single sensor, or a single curve parameter, is likely to be insufficient as a proxy for resilience of efficiency. Future research should focus on studying which combination of curve parameters and sensors are most informative as proxy for these two complex traits. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Automated tracking of animals has been successful in controlled laboratory settings but tracking animals in large groups in highly variable farm settings presents challenges. The aim of this review was to provide a systematic overview of the advances that have occurred in automated, high throughput image detection of swine behavioural traits with welfare and production implications. Peer-reviewed publications written in English were reviewed systematically following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. After identification, screening, and assessment for eligibility, 63 publications met these specifications and were included for qualitative synthesis. Data collected from the papers included camera specifications, housing conditions, group size, algorithm details, procedures and results. Most studies utilised standard digital cameras (n = 54) for video collection, with increasing 3-D monitoring in papers published in 2014 and beyond. Papers included pigs in production stages ranging from recently weaned piglets to mature breeding sows. Behaviours recorded included activity level, area occupancy, aggression, gait scores, resource use, and posture, among others. Our review revealed many overlaps in methods applied to analysing behaviour, and most studies started from scratch instead of building upon previous work. Training and validation sample sizes were generally small (mean = 10) and testing took place in relatively controlled environments.

The cameras use one or a combination of three technologies: structured light, time of flight (TOF), and stereoscopy. The objectives were to evaluate different technologies for depth sensing including measuring accuracy and repeatability of distance data and measurements at different positions within the image, and cameras usefulness in indoor and outdoor settings. Then, each camera was tested in a swine facility. Five different cameras were used: (1) Microsoft Kinect v.1, (2) Microsoft Kinect v.2, (3) Intel® RealSense™ Depth Camera D435, (4) ZED Stereo Camera (StereoLabs), and (5) CamBoard Pico Flexx (PMD Technologies). Results indicate that there were significant differences for all cameras (P < 0.05), except for TOF cameras (Kinect v.2 and Flexx). All cameras showed an increase in the standard deviation as the distance between camera and object increased; however, the Intel camera had a larger increase. TOF cameras had the smallest error between different sizes of objects. All cameras showed some distortion at the edges of the images. TOF cameras had non-readable zones on the corners of the images. All cameras except ZED captured a recognisable image of a pig within the swine facility. In conclusion, understanding the errors associated with each type of technology is needed. It appears from these results that the time-of-flight technology is the best to be used for indoor PLF applications. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The goal of this research is to identify management issues in the house and relate the outcome of a camera-based monitoring system for bird behaviour to key production indices. Three commercial broiler farms in Belgium were equipped with the eYeNamicTM camera-based monitoring system. The build-in image analysis software analyses automatically the flock behaviour by calculating indices for activity, occupation density and distribution of the broilers in the house. Feed Conversion Rate (FCR), Water-Feed Ratio (WFR) and Average Daily Growth Rate (ADGR) were calculated using production data extracted from the available controller units for 14 flocks. Between Sep 2017 and Sep 2018, several cases affecting bird behaviour were found. Deviations in behaviour were automatically identified by an early warning algorithm analysing the recorded activity, occupation and distribution indices. The Time Out Of Comfort (TOOC) was defined as the cumulative sum of these deviations per round. The correlation r between FCR and TOOC was 0.692. Per hour out of comfort, the feed conversion rate increased with 0.0069. Per hour out of comfort, the water-feed ratio decreased with 0.0050 (r = -0.537). Per hour out of comfort, average daily growth rate decreased with 0.1786 gram (r = -0.513). In conclusion, it was demonstrated that a continuous observation of flock behaviour allows the farmer to solve management issues as quickly as possible, which will improve the technical and economical key production indices on his farm. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

This feasibility study has clearly shown that a robot sensor platform can navigate through a flock of broilers during the majority of the growing cycle even on days with maximum stocking density.

The RFID system can identify and register the pigs' visits at the trough, the drinkers and a playing device at all times. With this system, it is possible to monitor a large part of the daily behaviour of pigs on group level but also individual level. Because a strong connection of behaviour to health issues is presumed, different approaches to detect illnesses, focusing on lameness, were tested. Along with the daily duration at the different hotspots, an approach to regard the first visiting time of a hotspot was examined.

With particular reference to dairy cattle farming, Automatic Milking Systems (AMS) and the related devices and control software represent a highly informative source of cow-specific data. Such data can be translated into useful indications for management and design through algorithms able to provide a clear characterisation of the animal within the herd. This study developed and tested a procedure for the comprehensive analysis of AMS-generated multi-variable time-series, with the following objectives: • to define clusters of cows on the basis of daily values of their descriptive parameters analysed over a selected time period; • to permanently monitor the time trend of the descriptive parameters of each cluster; • to identify animals with anomalous scores with respect to the herd. A commercial dairy cattle farm in the Po valley (Italy) was adopted as study case. A methodological approach based on hierarchical clustering has been formulated to best characterise each cow and identify cow clusters. The method proved suitable to identify clusters of cows clearly diversified in terms of parity, body mass, days in milk and daily milk yield, as well as individual outlier animals. The results lend support to cow monitoring and to herd management optimisation.

Registrations of RFID at specific places in a pen can be used to estimate the individual pig behaviour in order to detect abnormalities in drinking and eating behaviour. LF RFID tags were applied to pigs in the period from weaning until the start of the fattening phase. This was done in several experiments at the Dutch Swine Innovation Centre in the South of the Netherlands. In each experiment, 12 pigs were monitored, each equipped with a RFID tag in the right ear. Three readers were installed at the drinking place: (1) and at the feeding trough (2) video recordings were available to validate the results from the processed RFID readings. The performance of the system depended on the established reading distance of the readers. Tag readings were combined into visits by applying a bout criterion. Visits were combined into meals by applying a meal criterion. A good correspondence between tag readings and observed visits was found. A longer reading distance resulted in more tag readings that did not coincide with eating or drinking (but with resting behaviour nearby). Combining the two readers at the feeding trough as if they were one gave better results. The derived visits and meals can be used for detection of deviations on the number per pig per day (or per pig per part of the day). This automated detection can be a valuable tool in pig farming. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Integration of camera technology involves substantial intellectual input and computational power to acquire, process, and interpret images in real-time. Further, cameras and the necessary computational power can be cost-prohibitive and subsequently, become a constraint for application in a commercial livestock and poultry production systems. The purpose of this study is to develop an infrared proximity sensor based system to serve as a substitute a camera system to perform real-time monitoring of sow posture in farrowing stalls for a potentially lower cost and computational power. Monitoring sow posture can provide producers an indicator of farrowing and aid in evaluating sow demeanor during lactation. During the development of this system the long range infrared (IR) proximity sensors were individually calibrated, a sow posture algorithm was developed, and the IR-Sow Posture Detection System (IR-SoPoDS) system was evaluated in a commercial setting to a Kinect V2® camera for a range of sow postures. Average accuracy of the sow posture algorithm on the training data was found to be 96%. The overall accuracy of the IR-SoPoDS system across the three sow frame sizes were:87% (small), 90% (medium), and 89% (large).

Many methods have been published to monitor abnormal behaviours or components related to animal welfare. Monitoring animal welfare based upon objective physiological measurements, instead of audio-visual scoring of behaviour, would be a step forward. One of the obvious physiological signals related to welfare and stress is heart rate. The objective of this research was to measure heart rate (beat per minutes) on pigs with technology that has come available at large scale for humans and is developed for animals as well. This affordable heart rate monitoring for humans is using the Photo Plethysmography (PPG) technology. We have used PPG sensors on pigs to test whether it allows getting a reliable heart rate signal. We show results of the sensor against a reference measure for heart rate and this for an anesthetized versus a non-anesthetised animal. We have tested three different anatomical body positions (ear, leg and tail) and give results for each body position of the sensor. In summary, we can conclude that the agreement between the cheap PPG-based heart rate technique and a reference sensor goes from 91-97 percentage. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

A field trial was conducted in New Zealand over a two-week period from September to October 2017. Forty ewes were fitted with GNSS tracking collars, recording at three-minute intervals. Animals were visually observed to record birth events. Of the 40 ewes, 25 lambed during the experimental period. A heuristic model was developed to predict the day of lambing by classifying ewes as either 'non-lambing' or 'lambing' on each day of the study based on her speed of movement, mean distance to peers and extent of spatial landscape. Predictions were based on the series moving over or under a given threshold, determined through estimated least-square means from the linear mixed-effects statistical analysis. The overall accuracy of the model was 83.0%, with a sensitivity of 63.6% and specificity of 84.1%. The results of this project highlight the potential for GNSS tracking for post-hoc detection of lambing events. This could be used to inform graziers on the status of individual animals and their flock as a whole, particularly in extensive farming systems where close observation may be limited.

Automatic calving sign detection from cameras can help livestock farmers prevent fatal accidents to calves during calving. The following requirements were identified for such camera-based detection systems: 1) ability to work with a small volume of data (because calving events are not very frequent), 2) robustness to changing environments, and 3) ability to explain the reasons for the prediction results. However, these requirements are not realistic for end-to-end approaches such as the predictions using a single deep neural network (DNN). This study presents a two-stage calving prediction system, in which calving-relevant information obtained using a DNN-based feature extractor is used as the input for another DNN-based calving sign detector. The first-stage DNN extracts discriminative features of typical pre-calving behaviour in cows, such as increased lying time and tail raising. The former DNN is expected to achieve accurate feature extraction and to enable training of the latter DNN using small-scale data. Furthermore, the states observable from the video frames, which are outputs of the former DNN, can make use of the crowdsourcing for sustainable growth; moreover, these states can also provide the basis for the accurate prediction of calving. Experimental comparisons conducted using video scenes of five cows during the normal and pre-calving states demonstrated that the proposed system achieved a calving precision rate of 81% and a calving recall rate of 91%. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The cameras network takes pictures of the flock every 30 seconds. The pictures are then analysed by several algorithms in order to automatically detect the animals and estimate their positions on the pasture. The system was tested on a 1,300 m2 pasture with 18 creole goats and 22 kids. Based on 1,000 pictures selected randomly, the animal detection sensitivity was estimated to 81.3% and the precision to 97.1%. Unlike GPS, where one sensor per animal is needed, the system can be used to provide quantitative information on the entire flock using only three passive sensors. We used it to study the flock during two grazing weeks on the same pasture, with one month interval. We showed that from one week to another, the flock spatial distribution was highly correlated. The correlation is not constant but decreases gradually during the week, probably due to a decrease of the most appetizing resources. More generally, the flock successive positions can be used for quantitative studies on animal behaviour, animal health and welfare, or to improve pasture management. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Health disorders result in a change of behaviour which can be detected automatically by various systems for health monitoring in dairy cows available on the global market. For animals kept indoors, those systems reach high levels of accuracy and precision in detecting health disorders. On the contrary, for grazing situations the systems' performance is poor. In order to develop a system that detects the behaviour of grazing dairy cows and thereby identifies health disorders reliably, a large amount of behavioural data is needed and further factors influencing the behaviour of cows on pasture (e.g. temperature, precipitation, wind speed, available biomass, etc.) have to be measured. Therefore, grazing dairy cows were equipped with a sensor system attached to a collar, containing a three-dimensional accelerometer. The accelerometer recognised the cow's head and neck movements which are typical for each behavior (e.g. lying, grazing, ruminating). To assign the actual behaviour to the sensor data, the animals were recorded with cameras at the same time. Furthermore, climate data as well as bio and performance data of the animals were collected to allow the generation of algorithms for an automated recognition of animal behaviour. First results showed that the chosen methods provide a sufficient amount of data for the successful development of algorithms. After the algorithms are finalised, an evaluation of the system's accuracy and precision can be conducted. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Moreover, it reduced queuing behaviour and the number of severe lesions in a dynamic large group in a previous study. However, the previous studies trained the pigs within small groups of not more than 12 sows and used an electronic feeding station which could identify pigs at the entrance. In addition, they did not report the effect of the training itself on lesion incidence. The present study was conducted to validate the earlier results at a conventional livestock farm. Here, the training was performed within a group of up to 35 sows and with a feeding station which identified sows at the trough only. The training of the whole group required, in total, 180 days. First results show that signal feeding works under common practical conditions but might lead to more skin lesions during the period of transitioning from conventional electronic feeding to signal feeding. The associated higher level of aggressive encounters had however no significant effect on the rearing performance. Continued observations of further gestations will show whether the consolidation of the conditioning leads to a general reduction of aggressive encounters especially at group mixing. This might result in an easier integration of younger sows, which could be associated with an increased conception rate or improvement of the breeding results and would make signal feeding cost-effective in practical applications. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The value of pig carcass for meat production depends, primarily, on the carcass weight and on the relative proportions of fat and lean meat. This study focuses on the estimation of carcass traits for fattening pigs using image technology. An experiment with 80 pigs (Pietrain x Topigs 20) was performed in an experimental farm. Kinect® cameras were used to obtain 3D top-view images of live pigs during one week before slaughter while pigs were eating and an RFID system allowed the images to be matched with individual pigs. Several image features, such as lengths, areas and volumes were extracted to characterise the pigs' body. At slaughter, carcass traits were collected, such as slaughter weight, lean meat and back fat depth. Stepwise linear regression was used to determine which image features were relevant to estimate the different carcass traits. A dataset of 36 pigs was used as training set. Statistically relevant linear relations (p-value &lt; 0.0005), exhibiting adjusted-R2 ranging from 70-85%, were found between the image features and carcass traits. When applied to the 15 pigs used for validation, the performance decreased to the range of 50-60%. These results show the potential to estimate carcass traits of fattening pigs before being sent to slaughter from 3D image analysis. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

However, in current husbandry systems, broilers are often kept in large groups, which makes it difficult to identify and monitor them at the individual level. Sensor technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) tracking systems, might offer solutions. This paper investigated the recorded distances of an UWB tracking system that was applied to broilers, as a first step in assessing the potential of an UWB tracking system for studying individual levels of activity in broilers housed in groups. To this end, the distances moved as recorded by the UWB system were compared to distances recorded on video, using Kinovea video tracking software. There was a moderately strong positive correlation between the output of the UWB system and video tracking, although some under- and over- estimations were observed. Even though the recorded distances from the UWB system may not completely match the true distances moved, the UWB system appears to be well-suited for studying differences in activity between individual broilers when measured with the same system settings. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The objective of the current study was to test the localisation accuracy of the SMARTBOW system. A total of 318 SMARTBOW tags were evenly distributed across a Teagasc research farm and left in a stationary position for approximately 10 minutes. A Leica Viva CS15 GNNS Controller in combination with a GS 608 plus Smart Antenna recorded the true location of each tag. The distance between the location calculated by the SMARTBOW system and the true location (the Euclidean distance) was derived and results showed that 2.8% of the data had a Euclidean distance greater than 3 m. The maximum Euclidean distance observed during the experiment was 235 m. The mean absolute error was 0.67 m, the one sided 95% confidence interval of the Euclidean distance was 2.75 m and the 99% confidence interval was 4.93 m. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

These developments were not accompanied by the necessary increases in the size of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, nor sufficient enhancements of their functional efficiency. This has resulted in a relatively low capability for maintaining adequate dynamic steady-state mechanisms in the body that should balance energy expenditure under extreme environmental conditions. Thus, modern broilers have an elevated metabolic rate and consequently elevated internal heat production that leads to insufficient maintenance of dynamic steady-state of thermoregulation processes, resulting in enhancement of body temperature fluctuations. Today in most commercial chicken houses there are temperature and humidity sensors that provide mean values of the surrounding area. However, no direct measurement is being done on the growing broiler thermal statues. As a result, feedback mechanisms controlling the chicken-house climate might not respond according to the broilers thermal statues. Due to that fact we have developed a prototype of a new system which measures the broiler temperature in a production house. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Ten dairy Sarda sheep fitted with a halter equipped with an accelerometer (BEHARUM device) were allowed to graze for six minutes on micro-swards of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), chicory (Cichorium intibus L.) and a mixture (Italian ryegrass and alfalfa). Accelerometer data and video recordings of behaviour were collected simultaneously. The raw acceleration data was processed to calculate 15 variables: mean, variance and inverse coefficient of variation (ICV; mean/standard deviation) for the X, Y and Z axis and the resultant. A database was then created inclusive of the acceleration variables and herbage intake (DMI, g), intake rate (DMIR, g/minute), bite mass (DMBM, g) on a DM basis, and the logarithm of number of bites (LB) measured during the tests. Partial least square regression analysis (PLSR) was used to verify if the acceleration variables could be used as predictors of behavioural traits. The precision and accuracy of PLSR were evaluated implementing the Model Evaluation System, in which predicted values were regressed against observed ones, based on R2, RMSEP and Dent &amp; Blackie test. The PLSR showed an overall good accuracy (Dent &amp; Blackie test P = 1) and was proven precise for the estimation of LB (R2 = 0.86, RMSEP = 3%), DMI and DMIR (R2 = 0.71, RMSEP = 22%), but not of DMBM (R2 = 0.32, RMSEP = 26%).

The Cow's Own Worth (C.O.W.) is a new decision support tool, available through the HerdPlus web application or online account, to aid herdowners in making informed decisions on dairy females for culling and retention. C.O.W. ranks dairy females on expected profit for the remainder of their lifetime, specifically considering the genetic merit, permanent environmental effects, current states of the individual (i.e. calving date and parity), as well as predicting future performance in fertility, survival and somatic cell count. The theoretical framework of C.O.W. has been described previously by Kelleher et al. (2015). C.O.W. generates real-time rankings of each cow within the herd using the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation Oracle Exadata database. Each procedure is executed based on the most up-to-date information stored within the database. The objective of this study was to validate the performance of C.O.W. using herds that have actively logged onto the online service in 2018. Phenotypic performance records were used from 1,528 herds and 175,695 cows which accounts for 25% of the national milk recorded herd. Cows were stratified per quartile on C.O.W. value within herd. The top 20% on C.O.W. yielded 1,133 kg more milk and 124 kg more milk solids compared to the bottom 20% contemporaries. The quality and timely entry of data is crucial for the precision and accuracy of C.O.W. and benefits the industry by offering added value to existing services and increasing accuracy of genetic evaluations and key performance indicators. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

With the increasing availability of large amounts of data of varying nature, there is the challenge of how to store, combine, and analyse these data efficiently. With this study, we explored the possibility of using a data lake for storing and analysing sensor data, using an animal experiment as the use case, to improve scalability and interoperability. The use case was an experiment within Breed4Food (a public-private partnership), in which the gait score of 200 turkeys was determined. In the experiment, a gait score was traditionally assigned to each animal by a highly-skilled person who visually inspected them walking. Next to it, a set of sensor data streams was recorded for each animal, specifically inertial measurement units (IMUs), a 3D-video camera, and a force plate, with the ambition to explore the effectiveness of these data streams as predictors for estimating the gait score. The resulting sensor output, i.e. raw data, were successfully stored in its original format in the data lake. Subsequently, for each sensor output we performed extract, transform, and load activities, by executing custom-made scripts to generate tab or comma separated files. Lastly, by using Apache Spark it was possible to easily perform parallel processing of the data, allowing for fast computing. In conclusion, we managed to set up a data lake, load animal experimental data and run preliminary analyses. The data lake allowed for easy scale up of both data loading and analyses, which is desired for dynamic analyses pipelines, especially when more data are collected in the future. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The objective was to evaluate how a calving alert system, attached to the tail, affects the cow. The system monitors the tail's movements, and the farmer is notified via a text message to the mobile phone approximately one hour before calving. A case-control and an interview study were carried out. In the case-control study, cow behaviour was observed during and after the procedure of attaching the sensor on the tail. Controls were equally prepared, but the sensor was attached and then immediately removed again. The ethogram protocol contained behaviours like, for example, back arching, tail lifting, fidgeting and kicking. The case-control study had to be discontinued due to the sensors causing damage to the cow's tail and therefore, there were too few cows included in the study to be able to determine if there were statistical differences between the test and control cows. In the interview study which included 15 interviewed farmers, 80% stated that the cows' behavioural reaction was negative when the sensor was attached. Almost all farmers had observed damage to the tails after using the sensor and 20% had observed such severe damage that amputation was necessary. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

A monitor was developed containing an accelerometer and other gravitational measurement devices. It was attached to the upper side of the cow's tail approximately 6 cm below the anus. Three behavioural changes were monitored: (1) tail raise frequency and duration; (2) angle of tail raise; and (3) bouts of standing/ lying down. Measurement of these behaviours was taken every two seconds and the data transmitted to a receiver base. The device was tested on 20 dairy cows. The time of calving was established by 24 h staff supervision and CCTV. Of the 20 cows, 12 calvings were monitored, (six primiparae, six pluriparae); five unassisted, six easily assisted and one difficult. Prolonged elevation of the tail (> 30 - 45 degrees, > 20 seconds and four repetitions within 60 minutes), either alone or in combination with an abnormal standing pattern (within a 30 minutes period) were observed within four hours of each calving (unassisted calvings two - 3.3 h; assisted calvings 45 min - 3 h). Prolonged tail elevation combined with increased restlessness was indicative of imminent calving. The monitor was able to detect and record the pattern of calving behaviours and the algorithm was able to detect distinct onset of calving-specific behavioural change up to four hours before birth. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

This is increasingly difficult as animal numbers have increased and farmer's available time has decreased. But animal localization and monitoring systems are being developed that can support or replace direct visual observations. One such system is the SMARTBOW (Weibern, Austria) ear tag incorporating a 3-axis accelerometer and battery, with the claimed advantage of compactness and long battery life. The ear tag measures cow head and ear movement during, e.g. grazing. This monitoring and measuring system can capture an activity budget for the individual cow over the 24 h day. This ear tag has been implemented on commercial farms where cows are housed indoors, but research is required for its deployment on animals in pasture-based systems. Such work is on-going in Ireland and Minnesota, USA. The system was installed at Teagasc Moorepark in March 2017. Behavioural data of cows (grazing times) were collected by visual observation, as the reference method, and by deployment of the SMARTBOW ear tag. Specific algorithms were developed for cow behaviour measurement within a pasture-based system. Subsequently, a study was conducted to evaluate the SMARTBOW ear tag, including the newly developed algorithms, using RumiWatch as the reference standard. The SMARTBOW and RumiWatch systems recorded grazing times for 778 h at the Teagasc Moorepark location. Agreement between the SMARTBOW and RumiWatch for grazing behaviour was strong, with a Pearson correlation of 0.91 and a Spearman rank correlation of 0.84. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

A more detailed overview of the literature on the research of traditional meat products is also part of our work. This literature review is the basis to examine the adaptability of monitoring systems to free-range conditions, providing a basis for developing a tracking system for Mangalica and Iberian pigs. In our planned project we intend to adapt IT-methods and procedures to free-range pigs for offering an easy to handle, cost-efficient, useful IT-devices for monitor Mangalica and Iberian pigs, a possibility for gathering behavioural information about their pig herds and indirect data on the health status and production parameters of pigs. Changing the daily rhythm, detecting the deviation immediately makes it possible to detect and treat the sick, possibly infectious animals. By evaluating the data collected by the sensors, the farmer can get a comprehensive picture of the pigs kept outdoors without disturbing the animals. The data can be inserted into the production process of traditional products, so the premium quality associated with free-range pigs can be verified. With this adapted technology, it is possible to achieve precision pig keeping under free-range conditions.

We hypothesized that cows in a higher pressure grazing system, with reduced pasture availability and higher competition, would display greater standing times and reduced lying behaviour. Ten focal cows were selected from each of three spring grazing management plans, balanced for breed, parity and body weight. Treatments represented low pressure (LOW; 1,100 kg DM/ha grass available at calving, 2.75 cows/ha and 90% pasture diet), moderate pressure (MOD; 900 kg DM/ha grass available at calving, 2.75 cows/ha and 90% pasture diet), and high pressure (HIGH; 700 kg DM/ha grass available at calving, 3.25 cows/ha and 80% pasture diet) grazing plans. Groups were monitored from March - May 2018. Daily standing time, lying time, and lying bout and step frequency data were collected using accelerometers secured to the rear leg of each cow. Data from three, 10 d periods corresponding to the Early, Mid and Late spring grazing season were summarised by cow, day, treatment and period, and analysed for differences in behaviour. HIGH pressure cows tended to have reduced lying time and greater standing times (P = 0.07). Grazing period significantly influenced standing and lying time (P = 0.02), with a decrease in standing time and increase in lying time from Early to Late spring grazing. Additionally, lying bout frequency decreased while step frequency increased over the grazing period (P < 0.001). © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

However, recent research has shown that cows need training in order to be able to understand the virtual fencing mechanism. To improve the understanding of the cows it was envisaged to develop a new approach that supports the learning process. As cows rely more on visual cues than on audio signals, we set out to look into the possibility to use visual cues at least for training purposes. A first prototype with dual warning signals, based on audio and visual cues was developed. The idea behind it was to form a cue consequence association between the audio cue and the electric stimulus by temporarily supporting the learning efforts using visual cues. Therefore, a system based on a raspberry pi platform was developed. As a network and communication with a higher number of devices is paramount, the message queuing telemetry transport protocol was used. This protocol is particularly suitable for machine-to-machine communication through the 'publish/subscribe' functionality. Based on theoretical considerations and pretests, a possible luminaire design was created and simulated with a simulation software. A first prototype was built and tested under different light conditions. The system has shown initial promise. However, as the visual cues do not work in sunlight, the next step will be to develop an automated learning system, which could be used between dusk and dawn. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The cost, time and needed maintenance of off-the-shelf systems make them impractical for commercial farmers. We developed a system for measurement and estimation of the feed intake of all cows in a herd during all the lactation period with the goal to fit farmers' requirements. The feed intake was measured by a system consisting of four principal parts: (a) a hanging weighing system (simplified scales hanging on a single load cell), (b) a visual cow identification, (c) an automatic cleaning system, and (d) an algorithm for feed intake estimation based on a linear mixed effect model including milk yield and content, body mass, meal duration and frequency. The system was validated during a two-month experiment with six scales and 12 cows in a barn modelling a commercial one. The validation experiment showed that the system fulfilled the requirement: the three most inefficient cows were found by feed mass measuring. In an example of using the feed behaviour model two inefficient cows were correctly predicted. The scales were accurate within 50 g; the visual cow identification rate was greater than 96% and routine farm practices continued as usual, though with delay. The average cost for a feeding station was about $1,500. Thus, the system can potentially be used for ranking cows by their efficiency in commercial facilities. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

IDA uses sensor technology, cloud computing and artificial intelligence to support dairy farmers with insights on oestrus and health management. IDA analyses cow behaviour (originating from a 3D accelerometer on a neck collar) and herd patterns, and learns from the farmer's feedback. Within the Horizon 2020 project Internet for Food and Farm (www.IoF2020.eu) a field trial was conducted. The goal was to demonstrate that the IDA approach to generate actionable insights works. Therefore, we tracked KPI's on farm economics, animal health and fertility on two commercial dairy farms. We report the results of our trial from January to December 2018. Both farms had a herd of 100 cows, from which 50 cows were equipped with IDA. The farm KPI's were measured separately for the groups with and without. In comparison to the without group, the with group had, on average, its expected calving interval 5.92 and 0.88 days lower on Farm 1 and 2, respectively. Likewise, treatments with antibiotics 1.15 and 2.60 days shorter and 305 day milk yield 434 kg higher (Farm 1) and 405 kg lower (Farm 2) in the with group. For milk production the results are inconclusive as the groups were not balanced on milk yield before the trial started. We experienced in this trial, by qualitative feedback of the farmers, that the IDA approach worked and more observations are needed for scientific proof. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Several commercial systems are available to measure this behaviour. However, since these sensors can be expensive, it would be beneficial to develop a simple and cost effective system for this purpose. Thus, the objectives of this study were: 1) to optimise the setup of a UHF-RFID system for monitoring feeding behaviour at the feeding fence by passive UHF ear tags and 2) to characterise the size and shape of the reading area of the system testing two different antenna positions relative to the feeding fence and two types of UHF ear tags. A free-form UHF cable antenna with 6 m active length was placed along a section of the feeding fence in a conventional free-stall barn using pipe clamps. The two antenna arrangements were compared by manually measuring the reading range in a grid with four measurement heights in front of and behind the feeding fence. The measurements revealed that a greater distance of the antenna to the wall resulted in a higher reading range. However, the reading range decreased along the antenna. The antenna position closer to the feeding fence in combination with ear tag Type B showed promising results. Thus, it was chosen for further tests. In a next step, the system will be extended along the feeding fence and validated with cows using video observations. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The presented study is part of a project aiming to develop a system which is capable of an automated diagnosis of lameness in cattle by analysing their footfall sound. Data were generated from cows walking along a test track situated outside the stable where eight piezoelectric sensors recorded their walking speed and the footfall sound of their steps. Locomotion of the animals was scored and they were graded using a three-scale scoring system (LS1 = non-lame; LS2 = uneven gait; LS3 = lame). Subsequently, the cows were examined by a hoof trimmer. The mean walking speed at the test track was significantly higher in cows with LS1 (0.96 m/s) compared to animals with LS2 (0.76 ms-1) and LS3 (0.82 ms-1). The standard deviation of volume in the recorded footfall sound signal (SDFS) was considered as a factor for the force of cow's footsteps. Therefore, a higher value of SDFS describes an increased difference between a sound signal and no sound signal. Actually, cows with non-infectious diseases showed lower SDFS (0.017 dB) than healthy ones and those affected by infectious disease (both = 0.021 dB). This result confirmed the assumption, that in particular, cows with non-infectious diseases have a greater sensitivity to pain and demonstrate a less forceful respectively loudly gait pattern. These first findings clearly show the potential of footfall sound analysis for lameness detection. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Early recognition of animals that present atypical physical condition is important to prevent production losses. Currently, classification of body condition is done by subjective methods, thus is dependent on the opinion of the manager, which can generate differences between ratings. As alternatives to these subjective methods of classification, various methods have been proposed to obtain a more objective measure. Knauer &amp; Baitinger (2015) developed a calliper that quantifies the angularity from the spinous process to the transverse process of a sow's back and concluded that this instrument can be used as a tool to standardise this classification. Another way to standardise this measurement would be to automate the process by analysing images generated by depth cameras. The present work aimed to obtain sow's body condition score (BCS) using a commercially available depth camera. This was done by correlating the scores obtained with a BCS calliper (scores ranging from 1 to 29) with the sow's body widths acquired from depth images. A multiple linear regression was performed with an R2 of 0.61, a standard error of 1.36, and average absolute error of 8.01% (1.05 units). These errors may be associated with poor repeatability (human error) and/or the measurement calliper. It is considered that there is a need for a reliable gold standard and depth images analysis could be a possible option. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Previous work has shown that allocation of more than one grazing block per grazing bout can increase feed intakes and milk production. Bespoke LoRaWAN enabled collars with GPS and accelerometer sensors were developed. Accelerometer data (10 Hz) was calibrated to cow behaviour using 12 cows on four commercial farms, modelling the magnitude of the accelerometer vector on the cow eating activity (grazing or ruminating) using logistic regression (P < 0.001, accuracy = 95%) to give the probability of grazing. Collars were fitted to six cows on a commercial dairy unit for 18 weeks. GPS and summarised accelerometer data were collected every two minutes. Within a daily grazing bout positive changes in p(grazing) were accumulated and mapped against grazing activity. Once a threshold value for the accumulated positive changes in p(grazing) was exceeded, an elasticated 'bungee' gate was remotely triggered to give cows access to additional grazing. Drought conditions limited the preliminary trail to a one day-time grazing bout. Intakes were measured at 12 kg DM which is considerably higher than the typical industry figure of around 7 kg. Further work will develop the algorithms and the allocated grazing areas to assess if such gains in grass intake remain achievable on a wider range of commercial farms and with tighter control of the grazing residuals. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Data create the basis for strategic planning of work processes and for optimising production. This paper focuses on analysing working time requirement of different work processes to compare conventional feeding systems (CFS) and automatic feeding systems (AFS). Time data for various operations and working equipment were measured using video-based technology and time recording software. The evaluated data set provided the basis for data modelling and integration into a modularly structured calculation system. The modelling was focused on different assumptions regarding working time elements, technical details, feeding strategies and structural parameters. Four herd sizes of 60, 120, 180 and 240 cows were selected. The daily working time requirement was markedly influenced by herd size and feeding system. Feeding 60 cows using a CFS had a working time requirement of 43.6 manpower minutes (MPmin) day-1 whereas the AFS accounted for a time requirement of 12.9 MPmin day-1. The daily time needed for feeding enhanced with increasing herd size and decreased using AFS (120 cows: 71.6 MPmin (CFS) versus 16.0 MPmin (AFS), 180 cows: 97.7 MPmin versus 22.3 MPmin, 240 cows: 123.8 MPmin versus 28.5 MPmin). In conclusion, knowledge of working time requirement provides valuable calculation information and supports decision making at specific stages of the production and work process. Time scarcity can be managed by intelligently applying innovative technology. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The understanding of the interaction between animals and sward characteristics can be investigated based on detailed knowledge of the grazing process of animals. However, there are few sensors available to measure grazing behaviour of sheep for long-term periods. The RumiWatch noseband sensor is an automated measurement system, which is already validated and established for recording feeding behaviour of cows and horses. The objective of this study was (1) to validate two versions of prototypes of the RumiWatch noseband sensor, which were adapted to sheep and (2) to analyse the agreement, when raw data were converted with two different analysis software versions. Visually observed behavioural data for 16 Merino sheep were compared against data automatically gathered by the sensors. These sensor systems are able to record data of detailed grazing behaviour (such as grazing and rumination time). The results demonstrated that there is a high correlation detected for measuring grazing behaviour of sheep with the analysis software of cattle. There is an influence on the accuracy of the sensor based on the analysis software version as well as the prototype, the results are ranging between a Pearson's r of 0.90 and 0.95 for grazing time and r = 0.70 and r = 0.88 for rumination time, respectively. These results showed that there is potential to use the RumiWatch system for measuring grazing behaviour of sheep. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

However, due to implementation difficulties (handling, time consumption, investments) this type of monitoring is not very common on commercial farms. The development of three-dimensional imaging technologies is an interesting solution to meet these needs. The purpose of this study was to develop, test and validate a device (Morpho3D) offering the possibility of recording and analysing complete 3D forms of dairy cattle. To evaluate the performance of this tool, manual measurements were performed on 30 Holstein dairy cows: wither height (WH), heart girth (HG), chest depth (CD), hip width (HW), thirl width (TW) and ischium width (IW). They were compared to those measured from the Morpho3D device. Correlations between Morpho3D measurements and manual measurements were 0.89 for CD, 0.80 for HW, 0.78 for HG, 0.76 for TW, 0.63 for IW and 0.62 for WH. For the Morpho3D system, the repeatability standard deviation ranged from 0.34-1.89 (coefficient of variation (CV) from 0.26-9.81) and the reproducibility standard deviation ranged from 0.55-5.87 (CV from 0.94-7.34). These values are close to those obtained with manual measurements. This new device offers the possibility of measuring new phenotypes such as the total volume of the animal or the body surface and thus offers new research opportunities. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The hypothesis is that a dairy farm can substantially improve its economic and environmental performance by interacting, adopting and applying integrated, data-driven analytics and new technology. This paper presents a tool which was designed with a view to comparing the reproduction efficiency between farms with and without individual cow sensors (MooMonitor+, Dairymaster, Kerry, Ireland). The MooMonitor+ system accurately identifies when the animal is in heat. The tool was developed using dynamic programming in R (Shiny) and shows the changes of costs, revenues and net-return. The tool includes five panels (Reproductive Performance Indicators, Fertility General Report, Level of Milk Production, Summary and Economic Impact, Comparison with Farms using MooMonitor+). The model calculates from the first Day In Milk and stops when the last calf is born after successful insemination of each cow. The tool was tested using real data from farms. Differences in pregnancy rate of 20% (Farm 1) and 7% (Farm 2) (without MooMonitor+) and average pregnancy rate 27% (current average of farms with MooMonitor+) were recorded. The tool showed that this translated to farm profits of +124 (Farm 1) and +276 (Farm 2) EUR/Cow/Year, respectively. This improvement is partly caused by factors such as decreased breeding cost, decreased risk of culling and replacement costs, and increased milk production per cow. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

One strategy to achieve shorter milking times is to increase the milk flow switch point, i.e. the milk flow-rate at which the teatcup is removed. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of three teatcup removal strategies on box time (time in the AMS), milking duration, milk production rate and somatic cell count in a pasture based AMS. The three teatcup removal strategies tested in this study consisted of removing the teatcups when the quarter milk flow-rate fell below 20% of the quarter's rolling average milk flow-rate (MFR20), 30% of the quarter's rolling average milk flow-rate (MFR30) and 50% of the quarter's rolling average milk flow-rate (MFR50). The milk time (duration of the cow's milking) of MFR30 was nine seconds shorter than MFR20. The milk time of MFR50 was eight seconds shorter than MFR20. These results were statistically significant. No differences were found between MFR30 and MFR50. Additionally, there was no difference in milk production rate or somatic cell count between any of the treatments. The shorter box time for the MFR30 and MFR50 strategies could allow for at least three extra milkings per day. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

By predicting somatic cell counts for individual cows, monitoring of udder health can be improved by reducing both labour and costs for the farmer. During a period of eight weeks, milk samples from 380 Holstein- Friesian cows milked in an AMR were analysed once weekly for composite somatic cell count (CMSCC). Regularly recorded sensor data at quarter and composite level from the herd management system was stored and used as input to generalised additive models (GAM) used in the analyses. Several new conductivity variables were created combining quarter conductivity. Furthermore, past period values, i.e. lags of up to seven days (14 milking sessions), were added to the variables. A Multivariable GAM was fitted in order to compare the importance of the potential predictor variables as well as model performance. The variance in conductivity between quarters, one milk session before the CMSCC sample event, was the most important variable. Conductivity variables from combined quarters are suggested to be important in describing CMSCC. We conclude that using data from only six milk sessions before the CMSCC sample event is sufficient to obtain a relatively high degree of explanation (R2adj = 0.78). To evaluate the practical applicability of these results, we recommend investigating whether it is possible to predict CMSCC using GAM. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Suitable images were manually selected and subsequently processed using customised algorithms. This research compared the vaginal temperature, heart rate and respiration rate obtained from conventional methods (intravaginal loggers, heart rate Polar monitor and visual observations respectively) with the eye temperature, heart rate and respiration rate obtained from the non-invasive techniques (thermal images, RGB videos and Infrared videos respectively). The results of this study showed high correlations between the data obtained from conventional methods and the data obtained from these non-invasive methods.

A questionnaire was conducted with dairy farmers (F; n = 115), cattle veterinarians (V; n = 60) and Teagasc dairy advisors (A; n = 48). The 223 respondents were asked, 1) Do you perceive that expansion in the dairy industry poses concerns for dairy cow welfare? 2) Identify the main causes of poor welfare in cows and, 3) Rank in order of importance the main reasons for culling. A high proportion (c. 80%) of respondents in all groups agreed that expansion poses challenges for cow welfare (P > 0.05). The majority of farmers (22.6%) chose poor body condition as the 1o welfare issue; advisors (10.4%) and vets (8.3%), (P < 0.001). The majority of advisors (43.8%) chose social stress, different to farmers (14.8%, P < 0.05) but not to vets (30.0%), (P > 0.05). The highest proportion of vets selected lameness as a primary welfare issue (28.3%); differed from advisors (2.1%) and farmers (13.0%) (P = 0.001). The main reason for culling cows was infertility, followed by lameness and mastitis/high SCC. Vets (P = 0.01) and advisors (P = 0.021) perceived infertility as the primary reason for culling more often than farmers. There was a lack of consensus regarding the importance of lameness and poor BCS between stakeholders. This was surprising, and worrying, but probably reflects the differing focus/areas of expertise between the groups.

The main goal is to develop automata to collect several individual data on the behaviour and technical performances of piglets. We set up on IFIP's (French pig and pork institute) experimental farm in Romillé (France), six pens of 17 piglets with three types of automata: a connected feeder, a connected drinker and an automatic weighing station located in front of the drinker. Each automat uses radiofrequency identification to detect the individual ear tag of the piglets. For the weighing station, we compared the average of the individual data from the automatic device to manual individual weighing to assess the accuracy. The average difference was less than 1.5% and non-significant when compared within a given weight range (light/medium/heavy). Previous studies illustrate the importance of weight in correctly understanding piglets' feeding and drinking behaviour. On average, individual water consumption was 10.5% (± 5.2) and for feed was 4.6% (± 1.7) of body weight. For both feeding and drinking there was a large inter and intra individual variability: approximately 30-40% for water and 20-30% for feed. After development, optimisation and tests of these automata, all the data were collected in one database. Further research, in progress, is needed to utilise these data collection techniques in the development of an individual early diseases detection for piglets. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

For that, we devised a machine learning model that correlates ewe traits to lamb survival, and figured out as to which ewe traits explain the correlation and hence help us to identify the better mother. In this study, we kept pregnant ewes under 24 h observation by two researchers starting approximately three days before expected parturition dates. We conducted the study using native and crossbreed lambs produced in high altitude and cold climate region. It is critical to note that parturation took place with minimum interruption unless there is a birth difficulty. Independent variables used in the machine learning model pertain to mother's behaviours during parturation, however, we also took into consideration factors like dam breed, dam body weight at lambing, age of dam, litter size at birth, lamb breed and sex. Lamb survival is a nominal output variable, hence we tried out several classification algorithms like Bayesian Methods, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine and Tree Based Algorithms. Classification algorithms applied for lamb survival were Bayesian Methods, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine and Trees. RandomForest algorithm was found best performer among tree algorithms. We were able to present tree visualisation for mothering ability with 80% accuracy rate and 0.43 Kappa Statistics. The result of the study shows that grooming behaviour is the first determinant mothering ability. If the grooming duration is longer than 15 minutes, then it is a good mother. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Twelve Holstein cows with successful artificial insemination (AI) were used in this study. The sensors were attached two weeks before the expected day of oestrus and removed after AI. Different cow variables (e.g. lying time, number of steps, ruminating time, travelled distance) were extracted from the raw sensor data and used to build and test the detection models. Logistic regression models were developed for each individual sensor as well as for each combination of sensors (two or three). The performances were similar when one sensor was used only as when combining the neck- and leg-mounted accelerometer (sensitivity (Se) =75-78%, area under curve (AUC) =93-94%). The performance increased when localisation was combined with either the neck- or leg-mounted accelerometer, especially for the sensitivity (80% for leg accelerometer + localisation and 88% for neck accelerometer + localisation). The AUC were nearly the same (97%). The best performance was obtained with the combination of all three sensors (Se = 90%, AUC = 99%). Future work will consist of expanding this research to other herds with larger sample size as well as considering cows' anomalies (e.g. mastitis, lameness) and other sensors (e.g. bolus or eartag to measure the temperature). © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

However, the measurement of individual herbage dry matter intake (hDMI) of individual cows is laborious and may be challenging in commercial grass-based dairy systems. The aim of this study was to assess the application potential of machine learning algorithms (random forest) to estimate the individual hDMI of grazing dairy cows in an intensive grazing management system using animal behaviour characteristics. This study was performed at a research farm on n = 41 animals with the established reference value for measuring feed intake based on the n-alkane technique. The database for model development included individual cow information, on-field grass measurements, grass quality as well as detailed individual cow behavioural characteristics based on the RumiWatchSystem. Random forest regression was used to predict hDMI. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used to select the best subset of predictors to be included in the model. To overcome issues associated with the relatively small sample size of n = 68 weekly values in total a nested cross-validation procedure was implemented. Results showed that RF has good potential for the prediction of hDMI in grazing dairy cattle. However, further studies are required to fully assess performance of this method and identify new potential predictors for hDMI. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

However, these automatic mechatronic systems are limited in their potential. As the more and more intelligent systems are not able to communicate among themselves. In this context, the approach of a cyber-physical system leads to new possibilities of product and process quality. The connection of all/several mechatronic subsystems causes to a more flexible production process which can adjust and optimise the production regarding external influences to the system. This results in an reduction of workload, automatic documentation and traceability of the product during the production process. Risks arise from the system itself. Hence, an appropriate user interface is necessary to control the system. For this, the farmer must be able to define boundaries in which the system can run on its own and where human authorisation is necessary. For the future the approach of a cyber-physical production system for dairy farms will be expandable to energy management or infield robotic. © 2019 ASABE Annual International Meeting.

Heat stress in dairy farms has been reported to be a serious problem that leads to the drastic decline in milk production and fertility of dairy cows. In recent studies, wearable devices were used to monitor the behavior of individual dairy cows. However, such kinds of contact devices may affect the behavior of the dairy cows for several reasons. Therefore, designing a non-contact system that can monitor the behavior of dairy cows is recommended. In this work, an embedded imaging system that can monitor the feeding behavior of dairy cows was developed. The system includes cameras that were fixed in front of the feeding area to acquire cow face images. Cow face detection and recognition were performed on the acquired images using a deep convolution neural network (CNN) to record feeding behavior and identify individual cow faces. The cow face detector has an F1-score of 0.971 based on validation with a static image testing dataset. Meanwhile, the cow face recognition model was also validated with an average F1-score of 0.85 on 19 different cows. Finally, the predictions of feeding time were compared with the manual observation with the R2 0.7802 without the cows having lower recall from the recognition results. In the future, combining the feeding time and temperature and humidity index can be a health indicator of individual cows. © 2019 ASABE Annual International Meeting.

Despite these insights, laying hens are usually observed at the group-level with little consideration to individual differences in behaviour and their consequences. In a large-scale explorative study, the movement and location patterns of laying hens in a semi-commercial system was recorded by means of a RFID tracking system within four different areas (indoor, exterior winter-garden, yard and free range areas). Our methods allowed for characterisations of spatio-temporal patterns based on movements between areas as well as identifying non-random social associations based on co-occurrence at specific sites. We found that the laying hens developed a pronounced social network of differentiated individual associations that linked with spatio-temporal activity patterns. To characterise hens based on the level of similarity of ranging patterns, dissimilarity matrices were generated by Dynamic Time Warping. Cluster analysis suggests a small set of 4 - 5 distinct activity patterns with ranging patterns that were consistent over time and varied more between hens than within hens. Interestingly, similarity in daily activity patterns was highly correlated with social associations and closely associated birds became more similar with increasing age. To our knowledge, this is the first study linking animals' social niches with temporal activity patterns. The observed patterns and novel relationships identified revealed exciting opportunities to understand the complex behaviours of commercial laying hens and the observed variation in animal health, welfare, and productivity. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

However, microphones used in such systems have distance limits of sound detection. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the optimal placement and configuration of a continuous audio monitoring system in large airspace pig buildings to enable both a high sensitivity for detection and establishing directionality of clinical respiratory episodes. Audio sensor devices were obtained and installed in three large commercial wean-to-finish facilities designed to house 1,200-2,400 pigs per airspace. Five devices were installed in each of two 1,200 head buildings, spaced equidistant from each other along the center alleyway. In the 2,400 head building, 11 devices were installed, with four devices over the middle of the pens on each side of the building spaced equidistant from each other and three in the central alleyway spaced equidistant from each other. Where the device microphone was the center of a circle, the estimated optimal diameter for best detection of cough was determined to be approximately 18-20 meters. For optimal sound coverage in the 1,200 head buildings the optimal number of devices was determined to be four, and for the 2,400 head building the optimal number of devices was determined to be eight. Each device represents an 18-20 meter sound detection 'zone'. The detection and directionality of cough is then a function of the square meters covered by the 'zones' out of the total possible square meters in a barn. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Nowadays, estrus detection is often challenging for farmers because of a decreased duration of the visual signs of estrus, a less expressive estrus behaviour and a high proportion of estruses occurring during night hours. Hence, various technical devices were developed to assist the farmers in estrus detection. The company Smartbow GmbH (Weibern, Austria) developed the sensor system SMARTBOW for a wireless, continuous and real-time monitoring of dairy cows. The electronic ear tag contains an accelerometer for detecting head and ear movements in x-, y- and z-axis. Machine learning algorithms process the incoming data, analyse it for the expression of specific behaviours and activity levels and use the information for a purpose built decision function. Actually, data are available on an animal's activity, rumination and localisation inside a barn. The estrus detection function is primarily based on increased activity combined with distinct behavioural changes. Thresholds were developed by the company and the accuracy of the system for estrus detection was internally evaluated, so far. In this independent study, the SMARTBOW system was installed in a large commercial dairy farm in Slovakia, housing approx. 2,700 Holstein Friesian cows. Retrospectively, 579 estrus events were used to evaluate the accuracy of estrus alerts generated by the system. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, and error rate for detecting estruses were 97%, 98%, 96%, 94%, 96%, and 2%, respectively. In summary, the SMARTBOW system is suitable for reliable estrus detection in confined dairy cows. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The purpose of this project was to evaluate the ability of an audio-based sensor system to classify patterns of clinical respiratory disease in growing pigs according to their primary etiology under large-scale commercial production conditions. Audio sensor devices were installed in three large commercial wean-to-finish facilities designed to house 1,200-2,400 pigs per airspace. An algorithm-based respiratory distress index (RDI) was continuously generated from recorded sound files and uploaded to a cloud database. The data were charted and patterns of cough were categorised. For each RDI episode, diagnostic samples were collected and tested by PCR for PRRS, IAV-S, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, PCV2 and parainfluenza. Episodes were aligned with their corresponding diagnostic results and the resulting aggregate cough patterns were characterised. Two RDI patterns were detected across the three farm sites, one associated with IAV-S (H1N1 or H3N2), and another associated with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. IAV-S associated RDI patterns had a distinctive bi-modal shape, whereas the pattern associated with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae showed a gradual relatively linear rising pattern. The ability to classify cough patterns by primary etiology is useful at both a local site and global aggregate levels. With this information, local site managers can better adjust and respond with more timely, appropriate diagnostics and treatment. Further, those responsible for flows/systems and areas/networks can better assess larger scale behaviour of specific disease agents and the clinical impact of intervention and control protocols. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Milking time is an important factor in automatic milking because it represents the largest portion of box time and any reductions in box time can facilitate more milkings per day and hence higher production levels per milking robot. This study evaluated two removal milk flow switch points; 30% and 50% of average flow-rate at the quarter-level, a strategy to increase system vacuum during the peak milk flow period, and the interaction of these effects on milking time in an AMS. No significant differences in the milking efficiency parameters of milk flow-rate, milk yield, box time, milk time and milking interval were found between treatments in this study on cows milked in an AMS on a pasture based system, where average and peak milk flows of 2.15 kg / min and 3.48 kg / min respectively were observed during the experiment. Small increases in maximum milk flow-rate were detected (0.09 kg / min) due to the effect of increasing the system vacuum during the peak milk flow period. These small increases in maximum milk flow-rate were not sufficient to deliver a significant reduction in milk time or box time. Furthermore, increasing the removal setting from 30% of average flow to 50% of average flow was not an effective means of reducing box time. This was because the resultant increase in removal flow-rate of 0.12 kg / min was not enough to deliver practical or statistically significant decreases in milk time or box time. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The animal welfare can be measured with indicators capable of expressing the animals' adaptability to the environment. Temperature is one of the main components of the environment, since it influences the physiology, behaviour and productivity of the pigs. The first phase of this study aims to verify the adaptive evolution to different environmental conditions (summer, thermoneutrality and winter) in growing and fattening pigs. Seven females (initial weight: 45 kg) were used. The animals were housed in a room equipped with an environmental control system. The environmental data collected were temperature and relative humidity. The physiological parameters measured were surface and rectal temperature. The feed intake was monitored through an individual feed machine. In order to monitor the behaviour of animals, video cameras and microphones were installed. The final weight of the animals was about 95 kg. Respectively in summer, thermoneutrality and winter, the daily food intake was 2.111 kg day-1; 2.473 kg day-1; 2.814 kg day-1 and the average daily gain was 0.768 kg day-1; 0.923 kg day-1; 0.808 kg day-1. The corresponding values of surface temperature were 36.2 ºC; 33.6 ºC and 35.2 ºC and of body temperature were 38.9 ºC, 38.7 ºC and 38.4 ºC.

This parameter is usually recorded using rectal or cloacal probes, which can result in stress-induced hyperthermia and bias data. The aim of this study was to evaluate the interest of a telemetric sensor (Anipill ®) in the continuous monitoring of body temperature in chickens. This system is composed of a miniaturized electronic sensor (capsule) which uses wireless technology to transmit data up to three meters to a dedicated monitor. A single monitor can track up to 16 capsules. The system was first tested in healthy chickens to evaluate its safety. Oral administration was easily performed for chickens (weight 727 ± 65 g). The sensor persisted in the gizzard without adverse effect or macroscopic lesion during the observation period of 14 days. Temperatures measured with the sensors were correlated with the cloacal temperature (r = 0.34, p = 0.0001645). In addition, the system revealed temperature variations likely due to the circadian rhythm in the chickens. In a second experiment, temperature variations were recorded after inoculating animals with a very virulent strain of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). The inoculated animals were clinically monitored in parallel using a validated scoring regarding IBDV. Temperature monitoring revealed a dramatic hyperthermia following infection. Temperature variations were a more sensitive indicator of disease than the monitoring through clinical scoring. This sensor could be used for example to prevent heatstroke in poultry buildings or to improve models in infectiology research for poultry. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

This study assessed the use of an Infra-Red Thermography camera (IRT) to measure piglet temperature in the hour after birth, relative to the gold standard (rectal temperature; RT). At birth (06:00 ± 02:19 min post-partum), 32 piglets were dried, weighed, scored for growth retardation (GR; 0-3), and isolated in a plastic box. Immediately, IRT images were taken at a distance of approx. 1 m from directly above the piglet, followed by RT. The piglet was then returned to the farrowing pen, and the process repeated at approx. 15, 30 and 60 min post-partum. Temperatures of the ear base and tip, and minimum, maximum and average back temperature (shoulders to rump) were extracted with Thermacam Researcher Pro 2.0. Pearson correlations between temperature measures were calculated, and the effect of sex, time, GR score, and weight were included in linear mixed models (SAS 9.4). Temperature at the ear base was most consistently similar to RT across time points (P > 0.05), with the ear tip, and minimum back temperature most often different. In general, the worse the GR score, the lower the temperature; ear base and RT were lower in GR 3 piglets than all others (P < 0.05). RT was correlated with ear base at more time-points (3) than any other measure. An IR image from the base of the ear taken during the hour after birth could be a reliable, non-invasive method of assessing piglet temperature, and identifying piglets with a lower thermoregulatory ability. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

This has a negative impact on welfare and health status of sows. One way to reduce this negative impact is to confine sows in crates only in a critical period for piglet survival; from the beginning of farrowing until a few days after farrowing. In order to address this challenge in this study, ear tag based acceleration data were modelled to provide two types of alarms. The experiment took place in the research farm of The University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, Austria. The sow herd counted 140 Large White sows in total with 53 animals included in the experiment. Each sow had an ear tag with an accelerometer sensor mounted on the ear. Acceleration data was modelled with Kalman Filtering and Fixed Interval Smoothing (KALMSMO) algorithm. It was possible to predict farrowing on the basis of increased activity in the validation dataset with 1st quartile of 5 h 22 min, median of 8 h 51 min and 3rd quartile of 14 h 1 min before start of farrowing. Alarms indicating the need to confine a sow in a crate were raised with 1st quartile of 1 h 24 min after start of farrowing, median of 2 h 3 min and 3rd quartile of 5 h 38 min before start of farrowing. These results indicate that the developed model should be sufficient to provide early warning for approaching farrowing and secondary alarm indicating the need to confine a sow in a crate. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

With the new community cages now integrated into the Israeli egg industry, a manual head count of the hens is an impossible task. The aim of this study is to develop a machine vision system that automatically counts the hens, and helps the regulator to control the industry. The hen house that was used is 87 m long stacked on six floors, with 37 community cages set in a row, each cage is 2.4 m long, 0.54 m tall, and 0.74 m depth, housing 18-34 hens. The hen house has a narrow path along the cages. Consequently, a wide-angle camera was applied (HD Action Camera 1080p, wide angle 170 deg' lens) in order to frame the entire cage in a single field of view. The camera was mounted on a steel arm 0.85 m from the cages. The arm was connected to the feeder that moves along the cages. Videos with 30 fps were processed with an AI detection algorithm called Faster R-CNN. A feeding event appeared to be an adequate time to count the hens, as all hens were lined up in front of the cage, visible to the camera, making it possible to count. The detection algorithm was trained to detect hens in cages; it was tested on 4,000 images and got an accuracy of 80%. The algorithm count was compared to human observer count used as ground truth. The accuracy can be improved by further training the algorithm parameters. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Time windows, including 24 hours and 48 hours before the day of the event, were applied and the predictive performances were reported as Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Generally, the predictive performances were high for both volume and frequency (Tail biting finishers: AUC = 0.79 - 0.88, Tail biting weaners: AUC = 0.89 - 0.92). For finishers (30-110 kg), frequency (bouts/hour) was a better predictor of outbreaks of both tail biting and diarrhea as well as either of the events given either time window. For weaners (7- 30 kg), however, the performances for predicting tail biting were equally high for volume and frequency given either length of the time window. For the prediction of diarrhea or either of the events, the performances were also close to equal between volume (litres/hour) and frequency (bouts/hour) but they differed between the two lengths of time windows. In conclusion, frequency tends to be a better predictor of events amongst finishers, whereas the differences in predictive performances between volume and frequency were less distinct amongst weaners. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The aim of this study was to compare Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) analysis of faeces and Mid Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (MIRS) analysis of milk to predict the DMI of lactating grazing dairy cows. Faecal samples were obtained from four different grazing experiments where DMI had been estimated using the n-alkane technique resulting in a dataset of 1,083 cows. Equations were developed using the following variables; 1) milk yield (MY), fat %, protein %, body weight (BW), stage of lactation (SOL) and parity, which was used as a benchmark to which the following could be compared; 2) MIRS wavelengths, 3) MIRS wavelengths, MY, fat %, protein %, BW, SOL and parity, 4) NIRS wavelengths, 5) NIRS wavelengths, MY, fat %, protein %, BW, SOL and parity. The benchmark equation was more accurate (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.61; root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.68 kg) than MIRS wavelengths alone (R2 = 0.28; RMSE = 2.27 kg) or NIRS wavelengths alone (R2 = 0.15; RMSE = 2.45 kg). The combination of the benchmark equation with MIRS wavelengths (R2 = 0.64; RMSE = 1.58 kg) resulted in slightly more accurate predictions than the benchmark equation alone. The combination of the benchmark equation with NIRS wavelengths (R2 = 0.59; RMSE = 1.48 kg) did not result in more accurate predictions than the benchmark equation. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Many scientific papers on data driven methods for early mastitis detection have been published in the last decade. The performances vary greatly as well as the data used, the applied time window, and the gold standard definition. To compare the performances of these data driven methods, this study applied various data driven methods including time series filtering and classification methods (i.e. Naïve Bayesian networks and Random Forest) under similar conditions. Forecast errors and filtered means of the time series models were used to distinguish mastitis cases from non-cases. Moreover, we focused solely on electrical conductivity (EC) measures of milk to detect clinical mastitis. Data for this study were provided by Lely Industries and originate from 57 farms in six different European countries with a total of 1,094,780 cow milkings with EC measurements at quarter milk level. It is hypothesised that the performances with respect to mastitis detection will differ substantially between the different methods, and that the ranking of methods is not consistent across different datasets. Despite this, our preliminary results suggest that the performances of Naïve Bayesian networks and Random Forest do not vary much. The various filtering methods also present similar results. Although our naive approach of data handling allows us to compare different methods, we expect that each method in itself have the potential to improve when other (historical) variables than just EC are included. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Farmers using automatic lameness detection (ALD) system for continuous, accurate detection, coupled with proper treatment can reduce economic losses from lameness. It is reasonable to assume that the cost of lameness would vary with its severity. So our first objective was to estimate the cost of different lameness severity levels as a function of milk production, lameness risk, conception probability, mortality and treatment cost using a dynamic programming model. Our second objective was to conduct a cost benefit analysis for an ALD system which can reduce production losses through early detection of lameness, when compared to human-detection. The optimal profit per cow per year under assumed expenses and revenues reduced from $426.05 (when lameness incidence was assumed to be near 0%) to $388.12 when lameness incidence was assumed to be 19.7% (7.5% moderate and 12.2% severe cases). Cost per case was $192.54 at 19.7% lameness incidence. We used an operational framework which compared the lameness costs between human and ALD systems with 25%, 50% and 75% net avoided costs (NAC) for the 10 yr lifespan, at low, medium and high lameness prevalence scenarios. The break-even cost per cow per yr for using automatic LDS versus human LDS ranged from $13 (low incidence and 25% NAC) to as high as $99 (high incidence and 75% NAC) and justified the investment in automatic LDS with default price and 10 yr lifespan. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Hence, routine and proactive actions by farmers and veterinarians are intended to accurately and efficiently provide early detection of disorders. Nowadays, various sensor systems are available to assist the farmer in herd management decisions. Applying these technologies targets an improved health monitoring to secure high levels of animal welfare, ensure food quality and safety as well as in optimising work efficiency. The sensor system SMARTBOW (Smartbow GmbH, Weibern, Austria) consists of a 3D-accelerometer. Commercial features include estrus detection, rumination monitoring and localisation of animals in the barn. In this study the SMARTBOW system was used for retrospectively describing activity levels, rumination and distinct behaviours of diseased animals compared with their 'healthy' controls. For this, the system was installed in a commercial dairy farm, housing approx. 2,700 Holstein Friesian cows. Animals were enrolled at drying off and followed up to 70 days after parturition. Besides body condition scoring and metabolic testing, animals were clinically examined daily during the first eight days of lactation. Findings (e.g. rectal temperature, ß-hydroxybutyrate concentration) and diagnoses (e.g. Hypocalcemia, Ketosis, Metritis, Mastitis) were recorded and the data of 316 animals were used for statistical analyses. During the transition period, numerical differences in the average daily rumination time were observed between animals suffering from disorders and their matched healthy controls. Further in-depth analyses of the SMARTBOW data with and without considering combinations of captured parameters are currently in progress. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Moreover, these systems could allow inferring competition for a single feeder space in the form of multiple pig occupancy of a feeder during short periods of time. The goal of this study was to use automatic image classification to infer single pig and multiple pig occupancy of feeders and to contrast the results to those obtained from automatic feeder data. Top-down images of a feeder were collected every four seconds for three consecutive days. A total of 652 manually classified images were used to train a feed-forward artificial neural network for image classification. Over 64,000 images were classified using the trained model and 1,000 randomly chosen images from each feeder occupancy outcome (empty, single pig, multiple pigs) were selected for validation. Accuracy was 100% for images labelled as empty feeder, 99% for image classified as single pig (1% were images with two pigs) and 90% for images classified as multiple pigs (10% were single pig). Image timestamps were used to assign 64,000 classified images to 276 automatic feeder event data. 95% of feeding records with outlying high weights corresponded to a feeder that was occupied by more than one pig at least 24% of the time. While in events leading to normal weight records, 90% of the events had more than one pig in the feeder for less than 24% of the time. These results indicate a correlation between extreme high weight records and multiple pig occupancy of single space feeders, but the correlation is not strong enough to accurately classify events based solely on automatic feeding records. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The Pig Respiratory Distress package (SOMO) performs continuous and automated measurements of cough sounds, issuing a Respiratory Distress Index (RDI; average number of coughs/pig-day). The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between SOMO measurements and the prevalence of lung lesions at slaughter. SOMOs were placed in eight rooms, each with six pens (196 ± 4.6 pigs/room), on a commercial farm with a history of respiratory disease. A total of 1,573 pigs from four consecutive batches were monitored from 25 ± 5.3kg to slaughter, 114 ± 15.4kg, when their lungs were individually scored for pneumonia, scarring and pleurisy lesions. The relationship between lung lesions and weekly RDI was assessed using Spearman's rank correlation with room as the experimental unit. Results showed that the RDI during the last four weeks of the finisher stage was strongly correlated with the prevalence of pneumonia (rs = 0.72; rs = 0.82; rs = 0.89 and rs = 0.79, P &lt; 0.05) and scarring (rs = 0.72; rs = 0.82; rs = 0.89 and rs = 0.79, P &lt; 0.05) lesions. Even though the SOMOs are calibrated to raise an alert when RDI is ≥10, RDIs obtained in our study suggest that levels of coughing lower than expected (RDI ≥ 2 vs RDI ≥ 10) were also indicative of on-farm respiratory disease. In conclusion, the SOMO boxes could play a role in identifying respiratory disease in finisher pigs. However, a better understanding of the baseline coughing frequency in healthy pigs is needed. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Sub-optimal mobility is also associated with significant economic and environmental consequences, which have yet to be extensively researched or quantified in pasture-based systems. However, to quantify sub-optimal mobility in terms of its impacts economically and environmentally, and indeed to aid in the development of automated detection sensors for sub-optimal mobility, a clear understanding of the characteristics of a cow with sub-optimal mobility is required. So far, automated detection sensors have been successful for detecting moderate to severe forms of sub-optimal mobility. However, there is a need for a better understanding of the cow-level traits associated with all forms of sub-optimal mobility, including mild forms, to incorporate this into future development of automated detection sensors for sub-optimal mobility. Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine the associations between hoof disorders (both type and presence), body condition score, and all levels of sub-optimal mobility in pasture-based dairy cows using data from a large sample of Irish dairy farms. Mobility scores, body condition scores (BCS), claw disorder (presence and severity), and parity records were available for 6,927 dairy cows from 52 pasture-based herds. Binomial logistic regression analysis was completed to determine the associations between claw disorder (presence and severity), BCS, parity and sub-optimal mobility. The output variable was sub-optimal mobility (mobility score ≥ 1) and the predictor variables were specific claw disorders and their severities, BCS, and parity. Our results indicate that all severities of claw disorders, low BCS, and higher parity cows are all associated with an increased risk for sub-optimal mobility. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

To our knowledge, there is no study on the steps preceding the classification, namely accelerometer signal pre-processing in dairy cows. Using accelerometer data, the present study aimed to (i) evaluate the impact of the most commonly used pre-processing methods on the performance of predictions achieved with a classifier and (ii) evaluate whether this impact is related to changes in the relative importance of features used by the classifier. Ten dairy cows were equipped with a three-dimensional accelerometer fixed on a collar and were observed simultaneously. Several methods of pre-processing were combined, including different filters (high-pass filter and low-pass filter), window sizes and overlapping percentages. A decision tree was applied to classify the behaviours. The F-score was computed for each combination and an analysis of variance was applied to compare each effect. The relative importance of features was evaluated using the Gini index provided with the random forest algorithm output. The F-score decreased significantly (P < 0.001) when a high-pass filter was applied and the relative importance of features was modified, suggesting that the continuous component is essential for the classification. The increase of window size and percentage of overlap improved the classification (P < 0.001) but it was not explained by a change in the relative importance of features. No impact was found for the low-pass filter and normalization. Finally, the optimal setting includes no high-pass filter, a window size of 20 s and 30 s, and an overlap of 90%. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The EU H2020 FAIRshare CSA project (www.h2020fairshare.eu) aims to enable a more digitally active farm and farm advisory community. As one aim of this project, a digital platform will be developed to collect and distribute information on digital tools and services used by advisors with a view to creating an inventory for the acquisition, exchange and dissemination of Digital Advisory Tools and Services (DATS). The overall goal is to establish a platform for the sharing of digital tools, experience and motivation within the farm adviser community and the farmers they serve. This will include a multi-lingual, web-based catalogue and semantic search tool, ('Digital Advisor') which itself takes digital services and tools for farmers and advisers as its core domain. The semantic tool will assist advisers in identifying best-matching digital tools and alternatives to address specific, user-defined farmer's challenges expressed in 'common search language'. This platform builds on components established in the VALERIE project (2017). It will incorporate a permanent networking facility to allow users of the platform to share experiences of using the tools and to facilitate potential collaboration in updating the tools for a wider audience of users.

However, review and expert interviews with German farmers show that available solutions mostly are standalone systems. They lack compatibility with other technologies like already existing Information Systems and automation technology in dairy stables (e.g. climate-control, energy management or robotic milking). Farmers and researchers wish for a solution that integrates sensor systems, the control of actuators and existing information systems on dairy farms into one central information- and control-system. Moreover, an option to provide customized user interfaces to different stakeholders is required. This research shows, that a digital broker model as middleware offers manufacturer-independent opportunities to integrate existing information systems, wide arrays of different sensors and data transmission technologies. It further takes care of data management issues. The example of the TUM dairy research farm is shown, where a broker model is being implemented for research and teaching. Results show, that a broker model is a powerful tool to overcome most compatibility and connectivity issues and provides the desired solutions. However special aspects regarding connectivity must be taken into consideration on a dairy farm. Different transmission technologies are needed for different tasks, as a dairy farm offers very diverse conditions for IoT technology implementation. Customized user interfaces can be provided. Research is necessary regarding regulatory issues, and manufacturers need to be won over by the benefits of these systems, so that an integration of their technologies is facilitated. © 2019 ASABE Annual International Meeting.

Considerable research has been done to explore the relationship between group overall perch usage and well-being of laying hens. To quantify the potential cause-effect relationship on individual hens with different health or well-being status (e.g., keel bone deformation, foot pad lesion, social ranking) in a group, it is necessary to identify the perching behavior of individual birds. However, continuously monitoring individual birds in a group poses considerable challenges. To enable such research and potential commercial application, this study developed and validated a radio frequency identification (RFID) based automated perching monitoring system (APMS) for characterizing individual perching behaviors of group-housed poultry. The APMS consisted of an RFID module, a load cell module, and a round wooden perch. The RFID module was comprised of a high-frequency RFID reader, three customized rectangular antennas placed under the perch, and RFID transponders attached to the birds. The load cell module was comprised of a data acquisition system and two load cells supporting both ends of the perch. The daily number of perch visits (PV) and perching duration (PD) for individual birds were used to delineate perching behavior. Three identical experimental pens, five hens per pen, were equipped with the monitoring system. Two RFID transponders were attached to each hen (one per leg), and a distinct color was marked on the bird’s head for video or visual identification and validation. Performance of the APMS was validated by comparing the system outputs with manual observation and labeling over an entire day. Sensitivity and specificity of the system were shown to improve from 97.77% and 99.88%, respectively when using only the RFID module to 99.83% and 99.93% when incorporating weight information from the load cell module. Using this system, we conducted a preliminary trial on the relationship of perching behavior and body weight of laying hens, which revealed little effect of body weight but considerable variability in perching behavior among the individual hens. The study demonstrated that the APMS had excellent performance in measuring perching behaviors of individual birds in a group. The APMS offers great potential for delineating individual differences in perching behavior among hens with different social status or health conditions in a group setting. © 2019 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers","Individual perching behavior; Laying hen; Load cell; Precision livestock farming; RFID; Welfare","Agriculture; Anthropometry; Birds; Bone; Data acquisition; Monitoring; Transponders; Individual perching behavior; Laying hen; Load cells; Precision livestock farming; Welfare; Radio frequency identification (RFID); animal welfare; data acquisition; detection method; livestock farming; model validation; monitoring system; perching behavior; performance assessment; poultry; social status; Aves"

Scientific examination of cattle watering behaviour under varying conditions of climate, pasture and water availability (i.e. distances between water points) is required to inform water infrastructure development recommendations and maximise cattle productivity. This study assessed the potential of Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) reader data from remote weighing technology to examine cattle visit times and time intervals between cattle visits to water points. Data from three cattle stations in northern Australia was used. Daily weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, solar exposure and rainfall) were obtained from official weather stations located at or near each experiment site. Linear mixed-effects models were used to detect variation in cattle behaviour within and between stations. The RFID reader data showed that most cattle visits to water points occurred during daylight hours (between 06:00 and 19:00 h) and within 48 h of a previous visit. The time of day that cattle visited water points did not differ between stations (P > 0.05) but varied according to month (P = 0.001), period of day (P < 0.001), time since last visit (P = 0.013) and cloud cover (P = 0.043). Time intervals between cattle visits to water points differed considerably between stations (P < 0.002) and appeared to reflect seasonal conditions and water availability at each station.

The results of the study show that RFID reader data is able to detect behavioural differences according to climate and water availability and is a suitable tool to study cattle water point use.

This allows the possibility of multiple measurements of traits of interest with minimal animal stress. In the current study, an automated computer vision system was devised and evaluated for extraction of features of interest, as body measurements and shape descriptors, and prediction of body weight in pigs. From the 655 pigs that had data collected 580 had more than 5 frames recorded and were used for development of the predictive models. The cross-validation for the models developed with data from nursery and finishing pigs presented an R 2 ranging from 0.86 (random selected image) to 0.94 (median of images truncated on the third quartile), whereas with the dataset without nursery pigs, the R 2 estimates ranged from 0.70 (random selected image) to 0.84 (median of images truncated on the third quartile). However, overall the mean absolute error was lower for the models fitted without data on nursery animals. From the body measures extracted from the image, body volume, area, and length were the most informative for prediction of body weight. The inclusion of the remaining body measurements (width and heights) or shape descriptors to the model promoted significant improvement of the predictions, whereas the further inclusion of sex and line effects were not significant. © 2018 The Author(s).","depth image; image analysis; Microsoft Kinect; precision farming; swine","animal; automation; biometry; body composition; body weight; image processing; physiology; pig; software; Animals; Automation; Biometry; Body Composition; Body Weight; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Software; Swine"

In pigs, the muscularity of a live animal is traditionally estimated by visual and tactile inspection from an experienced assessor. In addition to being a time-consuming process, scoring of this kind suffers from inconsistencies inherent to the subjectivity of human assessment. On the other hand, accurate, computer-driven methods for carcass composition estimation, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography scans (CT-scans), are expensive and cumbersome to both the animals and their handlers. In this paper, we propose a method that is fast, inexpensive, and non-invasive for estimating the muscularity of live pigs, using RGB-D computer vision and machine learning. We used morphological features extracted from the depth images of pigs to train a classifier that estimates the muscle scores that are likely to be given by a human assessor. The depth images were obtained from a Kinect v1 camera which was placed over an aisle through which the pigs passed freely. The data came from 3246 pigs, each having 20 depth images, and a muscle score from 1 to 7 (reduced later to 5 scores) assigned by an experienced assessor. The classification based on morphological features of the pig's body shape-using a gradient boosted classifier-resulted in a mean absolute error of 0.65 in tenfold cross-validation. Notably, the majority of the errors corresponded to pigs being classified as having muscle scores adjacent to the groundtruth labels given by the assessor. According to the end users of this application, the proposed approach could be used to replace expert assessors at the farm. © 2019 IEEE.","Computer vision; machine learning; precision farming; RGB-D imaging","Agriculture; Cameras; Computer vision; Grading; Learning systems; Machine learning; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mammals; Muscle; Boosted classifiers; Carcass composition; Computed tomography scan; Cross validation; Human assessment; Mean absolute error; Morphological features; Precision farming; Computerized tomography"

Thus, warranting the need for animal supervision. The automation of monitoring of animals during this period is crucial to Precision Livestock Farming and the general animal welfare. The objective of this study was to develop an automated farrowing predictor by classification of sow nest-building behaviors based on non-intrusive, stress-free, contactless infrared distance sensors. Experiments were performed at Jurong Research farm of Nanjing Agricultural University, using a herd of 125 large white Landrace sows. Time-series data were collected from 14 crated sows, 10 were assigned to the training dataset and four as a testing dataset for final model validation. Cluster evaluation was performed by distance-based and density-based methods to determine the optimum groupings within the dataset. Subtractive clustering was then used to develop an optimized Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System model to correlate the infrared distance sensor data to the sow nest-building behavior. The cluster analysis gave a result of nesting and non-nesting behaviors as the optimum grouping within the dataset. The developed optimized model had an RMSE of 0.1516 for training dataset and 0.1173 for checking dataset. The classification of nest-building behavior by the model achieved an average accuracy of 89.00%, a specificity of 90.59%, a precision of 83.82%, and a sensitivity of 89.25%.

This research developed an ear-attached acceleration sensor of low power consumption for sow welfare studies. The sensor weighed only 10.0 g and was composed of a 3-axis accelerometer, a Bluetooth Low Energy module, a printed circuit board antenna, and a 3-V, 230-mAh CR2032 battery. It entered into a sleeping state when no activities of the monitored sow were detected, to conserve battery energy. In the sleeping state, the sensor still read data from the accelerometer at 1 Hz, but did not transfer data wirelessly to a receiver if a first-order difference that differentiated sow resting from its other activities was below a defined threshold. Laboratory and 8-sow field tests were conducted to assess the sensor performance in three operational modes (continuous, data grouping, and power saving). Results showed that there were three major behaviours of the sows (resting, moving, and eating) and the behaviour patterns differed from sow to sow. The ear-attached sensors could in principle be used to monitor and predict sow farrowing while not causing sow abnormal behaviours. In the continuous mode, data broadcasting consumed 97.6% energy and the battery life was only about 31 days. The average battery life could be extended to about 288 days in power saving mode when the first-order difference threshold was set at 0.1 g. Compared with reported similar acceleration sensors, this new sensor provided more than double the battery life while reducing the sensor mass by more than 70%. © 2018 IAgrE","Animal behaviour; Animal welfare; Precision livestock farming; Sensor battery life; Wearable sensor","Accelerometers; Agriculture; Animals; Bluetooth; Electric batteries; Low power electronics; Microstrip antennas; Printed circuit boards; Acceleration sensors; Animal behaviour; Animal welfare; Battery life; Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); First order differences; Low-power consumption; Precision livestock farming; Wearable sensors"

Existing lameness detection methods can be time-intensive, and under-detection remains a significant problem leading to delayed or missed treatment. Hence, there is a need for automated monitoring systems that can quickly and accurately detect lameness in individual cows within commercial dairy herds. Recent advances in sensor tracking technology have made it possible to observe the movement, behaviour and space-use of a range of animal species over extended time-scales. However, little is known about how observed movement behaviour and space-use patterns in individual dairy cattle relate to lameness, or to other possible confounding factors such as parity or number of days in milk. In this cross-sectional study, ten lame and ten non-lame barn-housed dairy cows were classified through mobility scoring and subsequently tracked using a wireless local positioning system. Nearly 900,000 spatial locations were recorded in total, allowing a range of movement and space-use measures to be determined for each individual cow. Using linear models, we highlight where lameness, parity, and the number of days in milk have a significant effect on the observed space-use patterns. Non-lame cows spent more time, and had higher site fidelity (on a day-to-day basis they were more likely to revisit areas they had visited previously), in the feeding area. Non-lame cows also had a larger full range size within the barn. In contrast, lame cows spent more time, and had a higher site-fidelity, in the cubicle (resting) areas of the barn than non-lame cows. Higher parity cows were found to spend more time in the right-hand-side area of the barn, closer to the passageway to the milking parlour. The number of days in milk was found to positively affect the core range size, but with a negative interaction effect with lameness. Using a simple predictive model, we demonstrate how it is possible to accurately determine the lameness status of all individual cows within the study using only two observed space-use measures, the proportion of time spent in the feeding area and the full range size. Our findings suggest that differences in individual movement and space-use behaviour could be used as indicators of health status for automated monitoring within a Precision Livestock Farming approach, potentially leading to faster diagnosis and treatment, and improved animal welfare for dairy cattle and other managed animal species. © 2018 Vázquez Diosdado et al.

Seven classifiers were evaluated using eight features extracted from the signal and combined into five sets. The three scenarios investigated were: differentiation between rumination and grazing (IR), food identification for four different foods (FC) and both situations combined (FCR). The segmentation window size effect on the accuracy was also investigated. We found an accuracy over 70% for IR and FC and nearby 60% for FCR using a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN).

The TE sensor array (TESA; Part 1) provides the opportunity to simultaneously quantify Tdb, RH, airspeed, and black globe temperature, but there are no existing methods incorporating these additional TE parameters to accurately assess the TE based on the thermal demands of the animal. Hence, the goal of Part 2 of this series was to develop a technique for evaluating the TE as a function of mean body temperature difference from thermally comfortable (ΔTb) using body mass, Tdb, RH, and airspeed inputs. Multiple regression analysis of the simulated data from the mechanistic thermal balance model for group-housed growing pigs was used to develop the Housed Swine Heat Stress Index (HS2I), which scales impact of the TE from 0 (thermally comfortable) to 10 (severe heat stress). Further, a wetted skin adjustment parameter was included to enable analysing TE with sprinklers. Simulated and predicted ΔTb agreed well without wetted skin (R2 = 0.98; RMSE = 0.061 °C) and with wetted skin (R2 = 0.97; RMSE = 0.054 °C). The HS2I was applied to assess the spatiotemporal TE data collected by TESA in the commercial grow-finish facility presented in Part 1. HS2I can be used to evaluate the potential impact of the TE in existing facilities and as a design tool to explore different ventilation and cooling strategies. © 2018 IAgrE","Heat stress; Pigs; Precision livestock farming; Thermal index; Ventilation","Agriculture; Hose; Humidity control; Mammals; Regression analysis; Thermal stress; Ventilation; Wetting; Adjustment parameter; Assessment technique; Dry bulb temperature; Heat stress; Multiple regression analysis; Pigs; Precision livestock farming; Thermal index; Heating"

Further, techniques for combining additional parameters are needed to adequately assess the total impact of the TE on the animals. Hence, two papers introduce a spatial network of 44 Thermal Environment Sensor Arrays (TESAs), each with a custom data acquisition system (Part 1) and a technique for evaluating the TE as a function of mean body temperature difference from thermally comfortable pigs using estimated body mass and TESA measurements as inputs (Part 2). The TESAs and new thermal index were deployed in a commercial pig facility to perform a preliminary assessment of robustness and capabilities under production settings. Each TESA measured dry-bulb temperature (Tdb), black globe temperature, airspeed, and relative humidity (RH), and required a custom circuit board with a microcontroller, signal conditioning, and communication hardware. After closeout (completion of the production cycle), TESAs were validated with a reference system to determine individual time constants and assess if a significant bias correction was needed (except airspeed). Total number of usable measurements for subsequent analysis for all sensors per TESA averaged (95% CI) 202,310 (199,187; 205,437). In summary, 7% Tdb thermistor, 9% digital Tdb, and 27% RH sensors required correction after 170 d inside the facility.

For this reason, different professional figures work on the development of drug reduction strategies. Due to the high priority of this issue, early detection of any health problem is of great importance in intensive farming. Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), through the combination of cheap technologies and specific algorithms, can provide valuable and rapid information for farmers starting from the huge amount of data that can be collected in real time at farm level. A prototype, able to give information about air fingerprint, was developed and tested in an experimental poultry farm in order to observe if air quality data were related to the presence of coccidiosis. Air samples were collected once a week in Nalophan® bags and transported to the laboratory for instrumental analysis. The prototype was able to discriminate between infected and not infected pens at a very early stage, when only 250 oocysts g−1 [faeces] (opg) were present in one pen. These results were also confirmed by analysing air samples in a commercial poultry farm, since all samples were correctly classified by the prototype in infected or not infected pen. This pilot study has shown that this technology could be installed in farms to continuously monitor health status of broilers, supporting farmers in the sustainable management of their activities. © 2018 IAgrE","Air quality; Coccidiosis detection; Poultry; Precision Livestock Farming; Volatile Organic Compounds","Air quality; Antibiotics; Poultry; Sustainable development; Volatile organic compounds; Air quality data; Antibiotic resistance; Drug reductions; Farming system; Instrumental analysis; Management practices; Precision livestock farming; Sustainable management; Agriculture"

First, a barn is segmented into delimited areas (e.g. cubicles) with which an activity can be associated (e.g. resting), then a real-time location system (RTLS) can be used to automatically convert cow position into behaviour. Working within the EU-PLF project, we tested a system already able to determine basic activities (resting, moving, eating…) and logged a “big data” set of billions of data points (123 days × 190 cows × 1 location-per-second readings). We then focused on integrating image analysis techniques to help visualise and analyse the dataset, first to validate the data and then to enrich the information extracted. The algorithm developed using freely available tools quickly confirmed the ability of the system to determine cows’ main activities (except drinking behaviour), even with 11% of positions missing. The good localisation precision (16 cm) made it possible to enrich the time-budget with new activities such as using brushes and licking mineral blocks. For both activities, using visual observations as gold standard, activity profiles with excellent sensitivity (nearly 80%) were extracted.

However, this is time consuming and precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies can enable the monitoring of such key flock behavioural indicators in a continuous and automated way in the house. The aim is to show how the welfare status of the poultry flock can be evaluated by real-time monitoring of activity and occupation patterns. Four top view cameras were installed in a commercial broiler house for 9 complete growing cycles. The cameras recorded images continuously and they were translated into numerical values of activity and occupation indices each minute. Three welfare assessments were performed in weeks 3, 4 and 5 of each growing cycle according to the standardised Welfare Quality® assessment protocol for broiler chickens. A real-time dynamic model was developed to monitor and forecast the time evolution of these indices and the confidence intervals for normal behaviour over each growing cycle. Statistically relevant correlations (p &lt; 0.05) between the time birds spent in an alert situation during the growing cycle and the percentage of birds showing worse welfare scores were found for occupation deviations and foot pad lesions (R2 = 0.60) and activity deviations and hock burns (R2 = 0.70). Furthermore, these deviations can be located inside the poultry house through the relation between activity and occupation indices in specific areas associated with particular broiler behaviours, such as feeding, drinking and resting. Evaluating this relation, regular activity and occupation patterns for each behaviour were defined. This work shows that it is possible to link deviations in activity and occupation patterns of broiler flocks in commercial farms with the welfare assessment scores by human experts. This tool allows the farmer to evaluate the risk of welfare issues in the flock and to get early warnings about which bird behaviours are affected and the location in the house where these alerts are being triggered. © 2018","Activity; Behaviour; Occupation; Precision livestock farming","Agriculture; Birds; Cameras; Houses; Thermodynamic properties; Assessment protocols; Behaviour; Confidence interval; Occupation; Precision livestock farming; Real time monitoring; Real-time dynamic model; Visual inspection; Employment"

Farmers incur severe economic losses due to BRD. Additional to economic costs, outbreaks of BRD impair the welfare of the animal and extra expertise and labour are needed to treat and care for the infected animals. Coughing is recognised as a clinical manifestation of BRD. Therefore, the monitoring of coughing in a calf house has the potential to detect cases of respiratory infection before they become too severe, and thus to limit the impact of BRD on both the farmer and the animal. The objective of this study was to develop an algorithm for detection of coughing sounds in a calf house. Sounds were recorded in four adjacent compartments of one calf house over two time periods (82 and 96 days). There were approximately 21 and 14 calves in each compartment over the two time-periods, respectively. The algorithm was developed using 445 min of sound data. These data contained 664 different cough references, which were labelled by a human expert. It was found that, during the first time period in all 3 of the compartments and during the second period in 2 out of 4 compartments, the algorithm worked very well (precision higher than 80%), while in the 2 other cases the algorithm worked well but the precision was less (66.6% and 53.8%).

Therefore, the development of methods for monitoring the physical conditions of animals would improve animal well-being and maximise the profitability of swine production. The objective of this research was to validate the use of depth images in predicting live animal mass. Seven hundred and seventy-two depth images and mass measurements were collected from a population of grow–finish pigs (equally divided between barrows and gilts). Three commercial sire lines (Landrace, Duroc, and Yorkshire) were equally represented. The pigs’ volumes were calculated from the depth image. Linear equations were developed to predict mass from volume. Independent equations were developed for both gilts and barrows, each of the three commercial sire lines used, and a global equation for all combined data. Efroymson's algorithm was used to test for differences between the global equation and the two equations for the gilts and barrows and between the three commercial sire lines. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the global equation and the individual equations for barrows and gilts (p &lt; 0.05), and the global equation was also no different from individual equations for each of the three sire lines (p &lt; 0.05). The global equation was developed to predict mass from a depth sensor with an R2 of 0.9905. In conclusion, it appears that the depth sensor would be a reasonable approach to continuously monitor pig mass. © 2018","Image analysis; Kinect® sensor; Precision livestock farming; Swine; Weight prediction","Agriculture; Forecasting; Image analysis; Depth sensors; Global equations; Mass estimation; Mass measurements; Physical conditions; Precision livestock farming; Swine; Swine production; Mammals"

Several strategies have been proposed for this task but monitoring of free-ranging cattle for a long period of time has not been fully achieved yet. In this study, an algorithm is proposed for long-term analysis of foraging behavior that uses the regularity of this behavior to recognize grazing and rumination bouts. Acoustic signals are analyzed offline in two main stages: segmentation and classification. In segmentation, a complete recording is analyzed to detect regular masticatory events and to define the time boundaries of foraging activity blocks. This stage also defines blocks that correspond to no foraging activity (resting bouts). The detection of event regularity is based on the autocorrelation of the sound envelope. For classification, the energy of sound signals within a block is analyzed to detect pauses and to characterize their regularity. Rumination blocks present regular pauses, whereas grazing blocks do not. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm showed very good results for the segmentation task and activity classification. Both tasks were extensively analyzed with a new set of multidimensional metrics. Frame-based F1-score was up to 0.962, 0.891 and 0.935 for segmentation, rumination classification, and grazing classification, respectively. The average time estimation error was below 0.5 min for classification of rumination and grazing on recordings of several hours in length. In addition, a comparison for rumination time estimation was done between the proposed system and a commercial one (Hi-Tag; SCR Engineers Ltd., Netanya, Israel). The proposed algorithm showed a narrower error distribution, with a median of −2.56 min compared to −13.55 min in the commercial system. These results suggest that the proposed system can be used in practical applications.

Previous studies focused on developing mechanistic and empirical models to predict these temperatures. Mechanistic models based on bioenergetics of animals often require parameters that may be difficult to obtain (e.g., thickness of internal tissues). Empirical models, on the other hand, are data-based and often assume linear relationships between predictor (e.g., air temperature) and response (e.g., internal-body temperature) variables although, from the theory of bioenergetics, the relationship between the predictor and the response variables is non-linear. One alternative to consider non-linearity is to use machine learning algorithms to predict physiological temperatures. Unlike mechanistic models, machine learning algorithms do not depend on biophysical parameters, and, unlike linear empirical models, machine learning algorithms automatically select the predictor variables and find non-linear functions between predictor and response variables. In this paper, we tested four different machine learning algorithms to predict rectal (Tr), skin-surface (Ts), and hair-coat surface (Th) temperatures of piglets based on environmental data. From the four algorithms considered, deep neural networks provided the best prediction for Tr with an error of 0.36%, gradient boosted machines provided the best prediction for Ts with an error of 0.62%, and random forests provided the best predictions for Th with an error of 1.35%. These three algorithms were robust for a wide range of inputs. The fourth algorithm, generalized linear regression, predicted at higher errors and was not robust for a wide range of inputs. This study supports the use of machine learning algorithms (specifically deep neural networks, gradient boosted machines, and random forests) to predict physiological temperature responses of piglets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Bioenergetics; Machine learning; Piglets; Precision livestock farming; Temperature","Agriculture; Animals; Artificial intelligence; Biochemistry; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Errors; Forecasting; Functions; Learning systems; Physiological models; Physiology; Temperature; Bioenergetics; Biophysical parameters; Linear relationships; Nonlinear functions; Physiological temperature; Piglets; Precision livestock farming; Surface temperatures; Learning algorithms; algorithm; bioenergetics; empirical analysis; hair; livestock farming; machine learning; model; pig; precision agriculture; skin; temperature; young population; Animalia"

New method: Working with beef cattle, we evaluated the pedometer-like IceTag device (IceRobotics, Edinburgh, Scotland) that records step events, leg movement and body position (upright versus lying). We used partition analysis to compare behaviour as inferred from the device data with true behaviour as coded at high resolution from carefully synchronized video observations of 5-min duration. Results: Malfunctions reduced the target dataset by 7%. The correspondence between IceTag and video-coded step counts was excellent (r 2 = 0.97), and the device's indications of upright or lying corresponded well (error rate = 1.4%) to the video-coded values. However, the proportion of steps that could be matched individually was relatively low (65% at a tolerance of 0.5 s), and the indicated start of a lying bout was often triggered by leg movements of an upright animal. Partition analysis of Grazing versus Not-Grazing yielded an overall error rate of 22%. In both three- and four-way classifications of behaviour (Graze, Rest, Travel; Graze, Stand, Lie, Travel) error rates were low for non-graze behaviours, but only 25% of Graze observations were correctly classified; the overall error rate was 22%. Comparison with existing method(s): The IceTag device performed well in mapping the diurnal patterns of animal position and step rate, but less well in separating grazing from upright resting. Conclusions: Our results suggest that pedometry is not the ideal method for classifying behaviour when grazing is of paramount interest. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Animal activity; Partition analysis; Pedometer; Precision livestock farming; Step count; Video coding","animal behavior; Article; beef cattle; body position; circadian rhythm; grazing; leg movement; nonhuman; pedometry; priority journal; rangeland; rest; travel; videorecording; agricultural land; ambulatory monitoring; animal; animal behavior; bovine; devices; electronic device; evaluation study; female; herbivory; livestock; physiology; pregnancy; procedures; standards; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cattle; Farms; Female; Herbivory; Livestock; Monitoring, Ambulatory; Posture; Pregnancy; Wearable Electronic Devices"

Low tail posture is an early warning sign which could reduce tail biting unpredictability. Taking a precision livestock farming approach, we used Time-of-flight 3D cameras, processing data with machine vision algorithms, to automate the measurement of pig tail posture. Validation of the 3D algorithm found an accuracy of 73.9% at detecting low vs. not low tails (Sensitivity 88.4%, Specificity 66.8%). Twenty-three groups of 29 pigs per group were reared with intact (not docked) tails under typical commercial conditions over 8 batches. 15 groups had tail biting outbreaks, following which enrichment was added to pens and biters and/or victims were removed and treated. 3D data from outbreak groups showed the proportion of low tail detections increased pre-outbreak and declined post-outbreak. Pre-outbreak, the increase in low tails occurred at an increasing rate over time, and the proportion of low tails was higher one week pre-outbreak (-1) than 2 weeks pre-outbreak (-2). Within each batch, an outbreak and a non-outbreak control group were identified. Outbreak groups had more 3D low tail detections in weeks -1, +1 and +2 than their matched controls. Comparing 3D tail posture and tail injury scoring data, a greater proportion of low tails was associated with more injured pigs. Low tails might indicate more than just tail biting as tail posture varied between groups and over time and the proportion of low tails increased when pigs were moved to a new pen. Our findings demonstrate the potential for a 3D machine vision system to automate tail posture detection and provide early warning of tail biting on farm. © 2018 D'Eath et al.

Estimation of forage intake and monitoring the feeding behavior are key activities to evaluate the health and welfare state of animals. Acoustic monitoring is a practical way of performing these tasks, however it is a difficult task because masticatory events (bite, chew and chew-bite) must be detected and classified in real-time from signals acquired in noisy environments. Acoustic-based algorithms have shown promising results, however they were limited by the effects of noises, the simplicity of classification rules, or the computational cost. In this work, a new algorithm called Chew-Bite Intelligent Algorithm (CBIA) is proposed using concepts and tools derived from pattern recognition and machine learning areas. It includes (i) a signal conditioning stage to attenuate the effects of noises and trends, (ii) a pre-processing stage to reduce the overall computational cost, (iii) an improved set of features to characterize jaw-movements, and (iv) a machine learning model to improve the discrimination capabilities of the algorithm. Three signal conditioning techniques and six machine learning models are evaluated. The overall performance is assessed on two independent data sets, using metrics like recognition rate, recall, precision and computational cost. The results demonstrate that CBIA achieves a 90% recognition rate with a marginal increment of computational cost.

Using Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) in extensive mountain sheep systems could bring benefits for animal performance, economical performance and labour. This paper presents results from a 3 year experiment where PLF principles were implemented on an extensive mountain sheep farm and an assessment made of whether or not such an approach could benefit more marginal sheep systems. A 900 ewe flock (600 Scottish Blackface ewes, 300 Lleyn ewes) was divided equally into two separate systems, one where the flock was managed conventionally (CON) at group level, and the other where the individuals in the flock were subjected to a PLF management protocol where electronic weighing, recording and drafting equipment were used, linked to the electronic identification (EID) tags of the animals. Two main management strategies were compared and contrasted; one relating to winter feeding of the pregnant ewes, the other relating to anthelmintic treatment of lambs during the summer. Yearly labour profiles were created by measuring the time spent doing individual tasks associated with the two management systems. Net margins (£/ewe) were calculated for the two systems. Additionally, the yearly labour profiles were scaled-up using commercial data to quantify potential labour savings on more traditionally managed mountain farms if PLF principles were adopted. Analyses indicated that the two different management systems did not result in any significant difference in terms of ewe weights, mid-pregnancy scanning figures, ewe and lamb mortality rates, or lamb weight post-weaning. However, the proportion of lambs needing anthelmintic treatment was significantly reduced by 40% between the CON and the PLF, resulting in a reduction of 46% in the amount of anthelmintic used. Over a whole year, the total amount of labour required in the PLF management system was reduced by 36%. Across the 3 years, the net margin for the two systems showed an average difference of £3/ewe higher in the PLF. For a more traditional farm embracing a PLF approach, analyses suggested labour reduction of 19%, equating to £1.60/ewe savings. This study shows that it is beneficial for farmers to consider managing a mountain ewe flock at an individual rather than at flock or batch level using PLF technology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Labour; Precision livestock farming; Targeted selective treatment",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of position (ear and collar), sampling frequency (8, 16 and 32Hz) of a triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope sensor and window size (3, 5 and 7 s) on the classification of important behaviours in sheep such as lying, standing and walking. Behaviours were classified using a random forest approach with 44 feature characteristics. The best performance for walking, standing and lying classification in sheep (accuracy 95%, F-score 91%-97%) was obtained using combination of 32 Hz, 7 s and 32 Hz, 5 s for both ear and collar sensors, although, results obtained with 16Hz and 7 s window were comparable with accuracy of 91%-93% and F-score 88%-95%.

Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) is a promising approach to minimize the conflicts between socio-economic activities and landscape conservation. However, its application on extensive systems of livestock production can be challenging. The main difficulties arise because animals graze on large natural pastures where they are exposed to competition with wild herbivores for heterogeneous and scarce resources, predation risk, adverse weather, and complex topography. Considering that the 91% of the world's surface devoted to livestock production is composed of extensive systems (i.e., rangelands), our general aim was to develop a PLF methodology that quantifies: (i) detailed behavioural patterns, (ii) feeding rate, and (iii) costs associated with different behaviours and landscape traits. Methods. For this, we used Merino sheep in Patagonian rangelands as a case study. We combined data from an animal-attached multi-sensor tag (tri-axial acceleration, tri-axial magnetometry, temperature sensor and Global Positioning System) with landscape layers from a Geographical Information System to acquire data. Then, we used high accuracy decision trees, dead reckoning methods and spatial data processing techniques to show how this combination of tools could be used to assess energy balance, predation risk and competition experienced by livestock through time and space. Results. The combination of methods proposed here are a useful tool to assess livestock behaviour and the different factors that influence extensive livestock production, such as topography, environmental temperature, predation risk and competition for heterogeneous resources. We were able to quantify feeding rate continuously through time and space with high accuracy and show how it could be used to estimate animal production and the intensity of grazing on the landscape. We also assessed the effects of resource heterogeneity (inferred through search times), and the potential costs associated with predation risk, competition, thermoregulation and movement on complex topography. Discussion. The quantification of feeding rate and behavioural costs provided by our approach could be used to estimate energy balance and to predict individual growth, survival and reproduction. Finally, we discussed how the information provided by this combination of methods can be used to develop wildlife-friendly strategies that also maximize animal welfare, quality and environmental sustainability. © 2018 di Virgilio et al.","Human-wildlife conflicts; Precision livestock farming; Rangeland conservation; Spatial-multi-sensor approach; Sustainable livestock management","analytic method; analytical parameters; Article; behavioural pattern; competition; cost control; costs associated with different behaviours and landscape trait; environmental management; environmental temperature; feeding rate; geographic information system; livestock; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; precision livestock farming; predation risk; rangeland; sheep; thermoregulation"

The idea of real time monitoring assumes a simple way to measure variable that can give an early warning for the farmer providing clear and suitable alerts to help them in their routine. The prompt reaction to any change in health, welfare and productive status is the key for the reduction in drugs usage and for the improvement of animal wellbeing. In intensive poultry farms, enteric disorders represent a major health issue; these pathologies could be multifactorial and are a major cause of performances reduction. Monitoring poultry health status takes a key role for management to reduce chemicals/drugs and their costs. Nowadays, the preventive use of antibiotics in intensive farming system is common and this practice could lead to the spreading of drugs in the environment, contributing to the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance. Due to the high priority of this issue, it is of great importance the early detection of any health problem in intensive farming. Precision Livestock Farming, through the combination of cheap technologies and specific algorithms, can provide valuable information for farmers starting from the huge amount of data collected in real time at farm level.

This paper discusses (1) the intrinsic variability of the physiological responses of animals (which motivates monitoring cows individually), (2) what variables should be monitored for precision dairy farming and why, and (3) how to monitor these variables. For example, through monitoring individual cows' responses to heat stress, cows that are more susceptible to the negative effects of heat stress could be identified and subsequently managed in barns with higher cooling capacities while cows that are more tolerant to heat stress could be managed in barns with less cooling capacities. Cows are complex biological systems that consume feed and water, self-regulating under the given environmental conditions, and produce outputs and indicators for animal comfort (e.g., milk, core body temperature, and behavior). By monitoring the input and outputs, it is possible to infer the health, comfort, and production status of cows. Recent technologies to monitor animals are based on machine learning and computer vision algorithms. A brief introduction to these algorithms is given in this paper followed by a discussion on how these techniques and novel technologies could be used to monitor internal-core and surface temperatures, respiration rate, sweating rate, walking pattern, behavior, physical dimensions, weight, and body-condition score of dairy cattle.

One of the key parameters that influence animal comfort and production is heat stress. In the U.S., heat stress costs the swine industry $300 million per year. One way to study alternatives for reducing heat stress in swine is studying their heat balance using bioenergetic models. Bioenergetic modeling of animals requires surface area and geometrical properties of the animals being modeled. The current practice for obtaining surface area of animals is through empirical equations developed more than 50 years ago. The validity of these equations on application of present-day animals, which have changed because of genetics and nutrition, is questionable. Other approach has been to assume the animal geometry as a cylinder or sphere. The objective of this study is to determine the surface area of piglets using images from 3-D cameras and to compare the results against surface areas obtained using the current practice. The 3-D geometry of animals was obtained using Kinect V1 camera (Xbox 360) with ReconstructMe software and ZED stereovision camera. Post-processing of 3-D geometric meshes was performed in MeshLab and Blender.

Therefore, estrus is taken as the indicator of the best timing for insemination. Ovulation generally occurs at the two thirds through the standing heat period (Martinat-Botté, 1997). To maximize fertility, pig producers generally inseminate once every 24 hours during that period. Heat detection is a continuous challenge for swine production systems. It is time consuming and requires skilled workers. We propose a novel approach to determine an optimal timing for insemination in sows based on behavior analysis. Our system - called PigWatch - continuously collects behavior data from sensors mounted on stalls. Real-time analysis allows to find the statistically optimal timing for insemination based on behavior pattern recognition. Our system was used for 21 months in 7 commercial farms for 20,485 weaned sows. Our approach, when used as a complement to a daily heat detection, allowed to easily manage 99.78% of the sows. Without the daily heat detection, the algorithm could have precisely managed 79.46% of the sows. The developed system should be considered as a tool to use in synergy with the workers to achieve precision breeding. Commercial farm using our approach made an average of 1.32 inseminations per estrus and had an average conception rate of 89.52%. Precision breeding, as proposed here, has the potential to decrease skilled labor dependency, improve reproduction results, optimize the use of the best boars, and ultimately accelerate genetic improvement. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

To overcome these constraints, the present study proposes a model based on an artificial neural network (neural model), for individual assessment of the level of thermal stress in feedlot finishing cattle considering both weather and animal factors. An experiment was performed using two different groups of Nellore cattle. Physiological and weather data were collected during both experiments including surface temperatures for four selected spots, using infrared thermography (IRT). The data were analyzed (in terms of Pearson's correlation) to determine the best correlation between the weather and physiological measurements and the IRT measurements for defining the best body location and physiological variable to support the neural model. The neural model had a feed-forward and multi-layered architecture, was trained by supervised learning, and accepted IRT, dry bulb temperature, and wet bulb temperature as inputs to estimate the rectal temperature (RT). A regression model was built for comparison, and the predicted and measured RTs were classified on levels of thermal stress for comparing with the classification based on the traditional temperature–humidity index (THI). The results suggested that the neural model has a good predictive ability, with an R2 of 0.72, while the regression model yielded R2 of 0.57. The thermal stress predicted by the neural model was strongly correlated with the measured RT (94.35%), and this performance was much better than that of the THI method. In addition, the neural model demonstrated good performance on previously unseen data (ability to generalize), and allowed the individual assessment of the animal thermal stress conditions during the same period of day. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Animal welfare; Non-invasive measurement; Precision livestock farming; Soft computing; Thermal radiation","Agriculture; Animals; Correlation methods; Heat radiation; Neural networks; Physiology; Regression analysis; Soft computing; Thermal stress; Animal welfare; Dry bulb temperature; Non- invasive measurements; Physiological measurement; Precision livestock farming; Predictive abilities; Surface temperatures; Wet bulb temperature; Physiological models; animal welfare; artificial neural network; cattle; computer simulation; experimental study; livestock farming; measurement method; performance assessment; physiological response; prediction; regression analysis; solar radiation; temperature effect; Animalia; Bos"

Autonomous computer imaging systems can overcome this challenge. The system presented here utilizes a time of flight depth sensor and a digital camera to capture depth and digital images of each sow and litter, housed in individual farrowing stalls. Depth sensors were centered above the stalls on a triangular truss spanning the length of the farrowing room and mounted in waterproof boxes with attached lids, enabling them to easily be waterproofed when cleaning the farrowing room. Each depth sensor was controlled by a mini-PC housed in a waterproof box located on the wall behind the sow for protection of the electronics. Each box also contained a small display monitor for operator ease of access. Images were acquired continuously at 0.2 fps. Data files were transmitted via Ethernet cable to a switch, then to a disk station for storage. This system was implemented in three farrowing rooms, with each room housing 20 sows. Recorded image data were subsequently analyzed to quantify behaviors of the sows and piglets (future work) as affected by dimensions and layout of the farrowing stalls. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

However, the low profitability of sheep farming sector suggests production efficiency could be improved. Although the use of technologies such as Electronic Identification (EID) tools could allow a better use of flock resources, anecdotal evidence suggests they are not widely used. The aim of this study was to assess uptake of EID technology, and explore drivers and barriers of adoption of related tools among English and Welsh farmers. Farm beliefs and management practices associated with adoption of this technology were investigated. A total of 2000 questionnaires were sent, with a response rate of 22%. Among the respondents, 87 had adopted EID tools for recording flock information, 97 intended to adopt it in the future, and 222 neither had adopted it, neither intended to adopt it. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and multivariable logistic regression modelling were used to identify farmer beliefs and management practices significantly associated with adoption of EID technology. EFA identified three factors expressing farmer’s beliefs–external pressure and negative feelings, usefulness and practicality. Our results suggest farmer’s beliefs play a significant role in technology uptake. Non-adopters were more likely than adopters to believe that ‘government pressurise farmers to adopt technology’. In contrast, adopters were significantly more likely than non-adopters to see EID as practical and useful (p0.05). Farmers with higher information technologies literacy and intending to intensify production in the future were significantly more likely to adopt EID technology (p0.05). Importantly, flocks managed with EID tools had significantly lower farmer- reported flock lameness levels (p0.05). These findings bring insights on the dynamics of adoption of EID tools. Communicating evidence of the positive effects EID tools on flock performance and strengthening farmer’s capability in use of technology are likely to enhance the uptake of this technology in sheep farms. © 2018 Lima et al.

However, it is difficult to distinguish individual birds in a large group in order to relate perching behavior to health condition or productivity. To enable such research, this study developed and validated a radio frequency identification (RFID)-based automated perching monitoring system (APMS) for characterizing individual perching behaviors of group-housed poultry. The APMS consisted of a RFID module, a load cell module, and a round wooden perch. The RFID module was comprised of a high-frequency RFID reader, three customized rectangular antennas, and multiple RFID transponders. The load cell module was comprised of a data acquisition system and two load cells supporting the two ends of the perch. Daily number of perch visits (PV) and perching duration (PD) of individual birds were used to delineate perching behavior. Three identical experimental pens, five hens per pen, were equipped with the monitoring system. Two RFID transponders were attached to each hen (one per leg) and a distinct color was marked on the bird’s head for video or visual identification. Performance of the APMS was validated by comparing the system outputs with manual observation/labeling over an entire day. Sensitivity and specificity of the system were shown to improve from 97.77% and 99.88%, respectively, when using only the RFID module, to 99.83% and 99.93%, respectively, when incorporating weight information from the load cell module. This study revealed that the APMS has an excellent performance in measuring perching behaviors of individual birds in a group.

This type of behavioral analysis is highly dependent on reliable and robust tracking of individuals, for it to be viable and applicable on-site. In this article, we introduce a novel method for continuous tracking and data-marker based identification of individual cows based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The methodology for data acquisition and overall implementation of tracking/identification is described. The Region of Interest (ROI) for the recordings was limited to a waiting area with free entrances to four automatic milking stations and a total size of 6 × 18 meters. There were 252 Swedish Holstein cows during the time of study that had access to the waiting area at a conventional dairy barn with varying conditions and illumination. Three Axis M3006-V cameras placed in the ceiling at 3.6 meters height and providing top-down view were used for recordings. The total amount of video data collected was 4 months, containing 500 million frames. To evaluate the system two 1-h recordings were chosen. The exit time and gate-id found by the tracker for each cow were compared with the exit times produced by the gates. In total there were 26 tracks considered, and 23 were correctly tracked. Given those 26 starting points, the tracker was able to maintain the correct position in a total of 101.29 min or 225 s in average per starting point/individual cow.

Novel biosensing methodologies offer highly specialised monitoring devices for the specific measurement of individual and multiple parameters covering an animal's physiology as well as monitoring of an animal's environment. These devices are not only highly specific and sensitive for the parameters being analysed, but they are also reliable and easy to use, and can accelerate the monitoring process. Novel biosensors in livestock management provide significant benefits and applications in disease detection and isolation, health monitoring and detection of reproductive cycles, as well as monitoring physiological wellbeing of the animal via analysis of the animal's environment. With the development of integrated systems and the Internet of Things, the continuously monitoring devices are expected to become affordable. The data generated from integrated livestock monitoring is anticipated to assist farmers and the agricultural industry to improve animal productivity in the future. The data is expected to reduce the impact of the livestock industry on the environment, while at the same time driving the new wave towards the improvements of viable farming techniques. This review focusses on the emerging technological advancements in monitoring of livestock health for detailed, precise information on productivity, as well as physiology and well-being.

Knowledge of daily growth rates provides producers with information that can assist them in making effective management decisions. With the development of intensive sheep farming, small adjustments in production can have a large effect on overall performance and profits in growing-finishing units. The parameters of body size and body weight reflect the animal's growth development, production performance and genetic characteristics. By using the records of the body size parameters, producers can monitor and estimate the feeding programs, herd health status, individual sheep growth characteristics, breeding, and so on. So, monitoring body size and body weight in real time is necessary. However, the present way of determining these parameters is normally by men, e.g. the sheep has to stand on a flat place with correct posture during measuring the body size with measuring stick, tape measure, and so on, and the sheep has to be tied up or hung up on scales when weighting, which has the shortcoming in causing the stress reaction of the sheep. In this work, a non-contact system with 3 high-resolution cameras was developed for automatically obtaining both the body dimension landmarks in 3 views and the body weight (BW). A software, developed in MATLAB environment, has been used to process the images and to obtain the points position in the image and the distances between the points. The measured body parameters included withers height (WH), rump height (RH), body length (BL), chest depth (CD), chest width (CW), and rump width (RW). A left camera and a right camera were used to restrain errors of WH, RH, BL and CD, and the average was performed to avoid precision reduction caused by the object deviating from the camera optical axis when using a single side camera. sixty small-tailed Han sheep (adult, females, not pregnant) with different ages (from 12 to 36 months, mean 65.48±8.58 kg) were weighed and recorded with 0.1 kg precision scale in the morning before their release for feeding in order to minimize the post-prandial variation. The measurement results in farm showed that the complementary parameters of left and right views could improve the accuracy of the measurement system, and the average of several measurements could reduce the deviation from the actual value obtained by single measurement of the multi postures. The maximum relative errors of WH, RH, BL, CD, CW and RW were 4.73%, 2.55%, 2.50%, 3.95%, 3.80% and 2.90%, respectively. In order to prove the usefulness of the monitored parameters, the body sizes of each animal were used to predict the weight by a few methods, including single variable linear regression, single variable nonlinear regression, stepwise multiple linear regression (stepwise-MLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), radial basis function network (RBF), and support vector machine (SMV). Results showed that, the body size got by image processing and liveweight had a higher correlation. In the process of single variable analysis, only the BL was reserved to the prediction model, for it was more significant to liveweight. It was found that by using the SVM method, the standard deviation and average error in model validation were the minimum, which reached 3.82 kg and 4.32% respectively. So the parameters got by image processing can be used for monitoring the growth of sheep. Through the in-situ test, it proved that the real-time monitoring method of sheep's growth eases the livestock measuring workload greatly and overcomes the limitations of manual measurement, and it's worth popularizing and making more efforts to improve the precision management and welfare farming of sheep. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The future challenge is to develop interpretative tools to capitalize on high-throughput raw data and to generate benchmarks for phenotypic traits. We developed a dynamic model of female BW that converts BW time series into a vector of biologically meaningful parameters. The model is based on a first submodel that split a female’s weight into elementary mass changes related to biological functions: growth (G component), reserves balance (R component), uterine load (U component), and maternal investment (M component). These elementary weight components are linked to the second submodel, which represents the litter developmental stages (oocyte, fetus, neonate, and juvenile) that drive elementary components of dam weight over each reproductive cycle. The so-called GRUM model is based on ordinary differential equations and laws of mass action. Input data are BW measures, age, and litter weight at birth for each parturition. Outputs of the fitting procedure are a vector of parameters related to each GRUM component and indexed by reproductive cycle. We illustrated the potential application of the model with a case study including growth and successive lactations (n = 202) from 45 dairy goats from the Alpine (n = 27) and Saanen (n = 18) breeds. The fitting procedure converged for all individuals, including goats that went through extended lactations. We analyzed the fitted parameters to quantify breed and parity effects over 4 reproductive cycles. We found significant differences between breeds regarding gestation components (fetal growth and reserves balance). We also found significant differences among reproductive cycles for reserves balance. Although these findings are based on a small sample, they illustrate how use the model can be to adapt herd management and implement grouping strategies to account for individual variability. © 2017 American Society of Animal Science.

And they have a considerable relationship with animal's welfare and diseases. Therefore, perceiving animals' body and behavior information harmlessly is critical to livestock breeding. A research review of diseases detection, body conditions detection, individual identification, behavioral analysis, and so on with noninvasive monitoring technologies was presented focusing on some prevalent livestock, including pigs, cows, sheep and chicken. And a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of 3 noninvasive monitoring technologies, i.e. sensor monitoring, image monitoring and sound monitoring in all the aspects was presented in this review. Sensor monitoring has been applied in the monitoring of feeding and drinking behaviors of animals, the identification of location of free-ranging animals and daily behaviors monitoring. Various sensors such as temperature transmitter and acceleration transducer have been used for years, so sensor monitoring is more reliable compared with the other 2 technologies. However, it is hard to design stable and suitable sensors which can work for a long period of time under the bad conditions in animal husbandry. As for image monitoring, it has been applied in the estimation of weight and body contour of animals, behaviors monitoring and body temperature measurement. Images of animals are acquired by cameras and thermal infrared imager and then processed with different methods to mine information. Although image monitoring influences animals least, it is susceptible to lighting conditions sometimes. Algorithms need to be developed to improve accuracy of image identification and reduce environmental influence. Besides, sound monitoring in animal husbandry has been applied in diseases detection, emotional state recognition, daily behaviors monitoring and estimation of feed intake of free-ranging animals. Calls of animals can be easily obtained with microphones, while meanings and contents of which are essential to understand. Feature parameters and methods are fundamental to get animal's sound meaningfully. The combination of Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficent (MFCC) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is proved to have good performance. Sound monitoring technology shows good identification performance in laboratory, while it is not as good as what scholars think due to the noisy animal husbandry filled with people talk, noise of clanging doors and wind. Thus, there is a need to update algorithms to improve identification accuracy in animal husbandry. Those 3 monitoring technologies are harmless to animals during the process of monitoring, while some supervision methods now available worldwide require device implanting or operation to the livestock, which is hence detrimental for increasing welfare. Whereas for the noninvasive monitoring technology, it can effectively cut down the manpower consumption, reduce the damage and stress response during the monitoring, lower the influence on the animals caused by observer, and then enhance the animal welfare. Sensor monitoring, image monitoring and sound monitoring perform well in different ways. It is worth a try to combine 2 or 3 of them to realize better monitoring performance in animal husbandry. Many attempts of noninvasive monitoring have been made and many products have been applied in some western countries, while Chinese scholars attempted to study it just decades years ago. Considering this, Chinese scholars should learn from western scholars and develop advanced noninvasive monitoring equipment. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

However, consumers and the wider society are also increasingly concerned about the welfare, health and living conditions of farm animals. Awareness of animal needs underpins new production standards for animal health and welfare. Pig and cattle behaviour can provide information about their barn environmental situation, food and water adequacy, health, welfare and production efficiency. Real-time scoring of cattle and pig behaviours is challenging, but the increasing availability and sophistication of technology makes automated monitoring of animal behaviour practicable. Machine vision techniques, as novel technologies, can provide an automated, non-contact, non-stress and cost-effective way to achieve animal behaviour monitoring requirements. This review describes the state of the art in 3D imaging systems (i.e. depth sensor and time of flight cameras) along with 2D cameras for effectively identifying livestock behaviours, and presents automated approaches for monitoring and investigation of cattle and pig feeding, drinking, lying, locomotion, aggressive and reproductive behaviours. The performance of developed systems is reviewed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, error rate and precision.

Despite very promising advantages, such as a high read range and simultaneous identification of animals, the application of UHF transponders in ear tags still struggles with the strong influence that body tissue in the vicinity of the transponders has on the reading performance of the system. A detailed and precise investigation of the influence of ears on the transponder ear tags to support transponder development is hardly possible in on-farm tests with animals. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop an approach to measure the influence of pig and cattle ears on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and read range of UHF transponder ear tags on a test bench. In a second step, replacement of cattle and pig ears in the experiments with tissue models was tested to enhance the repeatability and comparability of results. Three sets of tests were performed with three different types of UHF transponders (1) to compare the influence on the read range and RSSI of the transponders at the front and back of pig and cattle ears, (2) to determine the repeatability of measurements with ears, and (3) to compare the influence of pig ears with that of two tissue models. Results showed significant differences between the front and back side of the ears for pig ears with better results at the back. The results for cattle ears were heterogeneous. The repeatability of measurements was low in all variants (front and back of pig and cattle ears) with repeatability coefficients of up to 10 dBm (RSSI) and 217 cm (read range). The tests generally demonstrated the strong and highly variable influence of ear tissue on the read range and RSSI of the transponders. Nevertheless, the results indicated that targeted detuning of UHF transponders can lower the influence of ear tissue on the reading performance, which is promising for the use of UHF-RFID in livestock farming. The method presented could be used in an optimised manner in the future to perform comprehensive tests and comparisons of different types of UHF transponder ear tags. © 2017 The Authors","Ear tag; Electronic animal identification; Read range; RSSI; UHF-RFID","Agriculture; Mammals; Testing; Tissue; Transponders; Animal identification; Ear tag; Read range; RSSI; UHF RFID; Radio frequency identification (RFID); cattle; experimental study; identification method; livestock farming; muscle; performance assessment; pig; sensory system; tagging; Animalia; Bos; Suidae"

Data were collected from 5 commercial broiler farms in 4 European countries, using 16 flocks and 33 assessment occasions. Lameness was assessed using established gait scoring methods (Kestin et al., 1992; Welfare Quality®, 2009) and took place at 3, 4, and 5 wk of age. Gait score (GS) was used to assess the birds’ walking ability, and automatic recordings of bird activity were collected using the eYeNamic™ camera system before, during, and after an assessor walked through the house. The variables used to predict the level of GS extracted from the camera system were: baseline activity, time from assessor leaving the house to resumption of baseline activity, average activity over that period, and Δ Amplitude (difference between highest activity peak after assessor left the house and baseline level). Age (&lt;0.001) and Δ Amplitude (P = 0.0002) were significantly related to GS, with the gait getting poorer with increased age and Δ Amplitude decreasing with declining walking ability. Both measures are thus included in a predictive equation.

The correct use of these data might improve animal welfare, and reduce emissions through the application of PLF techniques. Data were collected at five broiler farms and ten pig farms across Europe.

All data were gathered, stored and processed on a daily basis, and visualised on a web-based tool. End-users of the tool were trained on how to interpret the available information on the visualisation tool. This paper presents the development of this PLF data visualisation tool. The farmer's use of this tool and the early warning capabilities are described by six case studies.

To keep the mother sow in a farrowing cage is the established countermeasure. This facility is a compromise that results in an impairment of the sows’ welfare to the benefit of her piglets and the farmer. A natural behaviour pattern which is demonstrated by most but not all sows is to free the trapped piglet by a posture change. Promoting this behaviour through aversive stimulations is an alternative approach to reduce piglet mortality. This approach requires an identification and localisation of ongoing piglet trapping in real-time. The present study investigates the online analysis of piglet vocalisation for this purpose. The results show, that trapping related stress articulations are outnumbered by other stress related articulations by a factor of 1:140 in a farrowing compartment with only 4 sows. Theoretical calculations for larger compartments indicate that this ratio becomes even worse due to an increasing influence of vocalisation from neighbouring pens. However, the specificity could be increased to more than 95% and precision to approximately 30% while maintaining a sensitivity of approximately 70% by retrospectively applying context based event filters. This specificity would be sufficient to limit the average number of erroneous trapping detections to one detection per sow within 3 days without a substantial loss of sensitivity. Effective parameters for filtering were the age of the piglets and the sows’ body posture history. Calculations with hypothetical spatial event filters showed that this classification performance could be maintained even in much larger farrowing compartments. Combined with an aversive stimulation principle that can be applied to a whole region, this detection technology could be useful to reduce piglet mortality in loose farrowing applications. An already known and effective stimulation principle of this type is floor vibration. Such an active piglet rescue system would allow limiting the impairment of welfare to only those sows that actually crush piglets and to the time when piglets are being crushed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Active crushing prevention; Online vocalisation analysis; Piglet crushing detection; Precision livestock farming","Agriculture; Active crushing prevention; Classification performance; Detection technology; Effective parameters; Effective stimulation; Online vocalisation analysis; Precision livestock farming; Theoretical calculations; Crushing; animal welfare; crushing; detection method; developmental stage; livestock farming; mortality; performance assessment; pig; posture; theoretical study; trapping; vocalization; World Wide Web; Animalia"

Thermal stress events can cause reduced performance, morbidity, and mortality, resulting in significant economic losses and animal welfare concerns. Environment control in confined animal housing systems is typically based on heat and moisture production rates at predetermined ambient temperature levels measured between 1950 and 1980. This traditional control method can fall short in meeting the true thermal needs of the animals since it does not account for factors now acknowledged as affecting the animal's productive responses to surrounding conditions, such as humidity, drafts, radiation, physiological state, and social interactions. Also, advancements in animal genetics, nutrition, and management practices have led to considerable changes in sensible and latent heat loads of modern livestock buildings. In this context, precision livestock farming technologies (sensors, detectors, cameras, microphones, etc.), enabling the automatic monitoring of environmental, physiological, and behavioural variables, can be used to continuously assess livestock performance and well-being in relation to their environment. An innovative strategy for environment control of livestock buildings could include the analysis of: (i) heat and moisture production rates using the most recent bioenergetic models; (ii) thermal stress through multi-factor animal comfort indices based on some environmental and physiological measurements; and (iii) animal behaviour as a response to changing environmental conditions. This paper presents a critical review of the state of the art of precision environment control of livestock buildings, identifying knowledge gaps, research opportunities, and technical challenges. © 2016 IAgrE","Animals; Environment control; Precision livestock farming; Sensors; Thermal stress; Welfare","Animals; Environmental technology; Housing; Humidity control; Losses; Moisture; Physiological models; Physiology; Sensors; Thermal stress; Environment control; Environmental conditions; Factors of production; Moisture production rates; Physiological measurement; Precision livestock farming; Research opportunities; Welfare; Agriculture"

The need to analyse a large number of animals at a time due to the increase in the herd dimension in intensive farming has led to the use of automated systems. Among automated systems, inertial sensor-based systems have been utilised to distinguish behavioural patterns in livestock animals. In this study, a new approach based on statistical analyses of accelerometer data, which were collected from wearable sensors fixed at the cow's collar, was defined and developed in order to define thresholds suitable for real-time classification of cow feeding and standing behavioural activity. The obtained classifier could be implemented within a software tool of a movement sensor-based system composed of low-cost devices. Accuracy of the classification was assessed by computing specific indicators: Misclassification Rate, Sensitivity, Precision, Specificity, Quality Percentage, Branching Factor, and Miss Factor. The results showed that the classifier produced the following values of the indicators: 5.56%, 93.33%, 95.45%, 95.56%, 89.36%, 0.05, and 0.07, respectively. The proposed threshold-based classifier allows for monitoring individual cows automatically and continuously and it is suitable for Real Time Computing Applications, since it does not require high computational time and resources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Building for dairy farming; Cow feeding activity; Cow standing activity; Precision livestock farming; Sensors; Thresholds","Accelerometers; Agriculture; Animals; Automation; Classification (of information); Feeding; Sensors; Cow feeding; Dairy farming; Misclassification rates; Precision livestock farming; Real time computing; Real time recognition; Threshold-based classifiers; Thresholds; Wearable sensors; accelerometer; activity pattern; dairy farming; data set; equipment; feeding behavior; livestock; movement; real time; sensor; software; statistical analysis; threshold; Animalia"

A total of 58 Italian Friesian cows were involved in this study during summer 2015. Based on the temperature humidity index (THI), two different conditions were compared on 16 primiparous and 11 multiparous, to be representative of three lactation phases: early (15–84 DIM), around peak (85–154 DIM), and plateau (155–224 DIM). A separate dataset for the assessment of the variance partition included all the cows in the herd from June 7 to July 16. The rumination time (RT2h, min/2 h) and activity index (AI2h, bouts/2 h) were summarized every 2-h interval. The raw data were used to calculate the following variables: total daily RT (RTt), daytime RT (RTd), nighttime RT (RTn), total daily AI (AIt), daytime AI (AId), and nighttime AI (AIn). Either AIt and AId increased, whereas RTt, RTd, and RTn decreased with higher THI in all the three phases. The highest decrease was recorded for RTd and ranged from 49 % (early) to 45 % (plateau). The contribution of the cow within lactation phase was above 60 % of the total variance for AI traits and a share from 33.9 % (for RTt) to 54.8 % (RTn) for RT traits. These observations must be extended to different feeding managements and different animal genetics to assess if different thresholds could be identified to set an early alert system for the farmer. © 2016, ISB.","Activity; Cow; Heat stress; Livestock precision farming; Rumination","animal; animal food; bovine; cattle disease; diet; feeding behavior; female; heat injury; humidity; pathophysiology; temperature; veterinary; Animal Feed; Animals; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Female; Heat Stress Disorders; Humidity; Temperature"

Globally, a number of sensors being produced for animal health management are at various stages of commercialization. Some technologies for producing an accurate health status and disease diagnosis are applicable only for humans, with few modifications or testing in animal models. Now, these innovative technologies are being considered for their future use in livestock development and welfare. Precision livestock farming techniques, which include a wide span of technologies, are being applied, along with advanced technologies like microfluidics, sound analyzers, image-detection techniques, sweat and salivary sensing, serodiagnosis, and others. However, there is a need to integrate all the available sensors and create an efficient online monitoring system so that animal health status can be monitored in real time, without delay.

Papers included in this review are all peer-reviewed and present sensor-based detection models developed for modern livestock production with the purpose of optimizing animal health or managerial routines. The papers must present a performance for the model, but no criteria were specified for animal species or the condition sought to be detected. 34 papers published during the last 20 years (1995–2015) are presented in three groups according to their level of prioritization: “Sheer detection models” based on single-standing methods with or without inclusion of non-sensor-based information (19 papers), “Improved detection models” where the performance of the described models are sought to be improved through the combination of different methods (12 papers) and “Prioritizing models” where the models include a method of ranking or prioritizing alerts in order to reduce the number of false alarms (3 papers). Of the three methods that rank or prioritize alerts; Fuzzy Logic, Naive Bayesian Network (NBN) and Hidden phase-type Markov model, the NBN shows the greatest potential for future reduction of alerts from sensor-based detection models in livestock production. The included detection models are evaluated on three criteria; performance, time-window and similarity to determine whether they are suitable for implementation in modern livestock production herds. No model fulfills all three criteria and only three models meet the performance criterion. Reasons for this could be that both sensor technology and methods for developing the detection models have evolved over time. However, model performance is almost exclusively presented by the binary epidemiological terms Sensitivity (Se) and Specificity (Sp). It is suggested that future research focus on alternative approaches for the output of detection models, such as the prior probability or the risk of a condition occurring. Automatic monitoring and early warning systems offer an opportunity to observe certain aspects of animal health, welfare, and productivity more closely than traditionally accomplished through human observation, and the opportunities for improving animal welfare should continue to be a driving force throughout the field of precision livestock farming. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Automatic monitoring; Early warning system; Livestock production; Performance; Sensitivity; Sensor; Specificity","Alarm systems; Animals; Bayesian networks; Errors; Fuzzy logic; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; Monitoring; Paper; Sensors; Veterinary medicine; Automatic monitoring; Early Warning System; Livestock production; Performance; Sensitivity; Specificity; Agriculture; agricultural modeling; animal welfare; automation; detection method; early warning system; literature review; livestock farming; Markov chain; performance assessment; precision agriculture; probability; sensitivity analysis; sensor; Animalia"

PLF allows real-time management of different types of data (data from the animals, their feed consumption, the atmosphere in the barn, etc.). These data support decision-making by the farmer (e.g. management of ventilation and heating). PLF uses modern information and communication technologies to exchange, transform and provide feedback to the farmer. PLF can also involve the use of automatic systems and robots which relieve the farmer of certain tedious tasks. Soon, the farmer will be able to manage production, health, behaviour and welfare parameters of the flock in real time. A major issue is to learn from the multiple data generated and utilise it to create and develop appropriate livestock management tools for the farmer. Smartphone applications used outside the agricultural sector will be presented as examples of technology which can be transferred to the poultry sector. This prospect will make it possible to identify new approaches for the future of the poultry sector. The digital revolution provides an opportunity to rethink production systems. This revolution will encourage and facilitate communication between parties (product traceability and transparency among stakeholders). PLF technologies generate a huge amount of data, with various formats and sources. The challenges are to share these data between stakeholders and improve the statistical processing of big data to design and develop new management tools for the farmers. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Indeed, PLF may entrench the use of such systems by making them easier to manage. PLF can help prevent poor welfare by identifying early onset of disease and stressful situations, but it may be unable to respond to changing concepts of animal welfare. Mellor (2016) argues it is necessary not only to minimise negative experiences but also “to provide animals with opportunities to have positive experiences” that can arise when animals are kept in “spacious, stimulus-rich environments”. Will PLF be able to contribute to such systems? If PLF is mainly used in the intensive sector, it will be facilitating systems that tend to overproduce and undermine the environment. A Netherlands Presidency paper (2016) states that difficulties in the EU pig and dairy sectors stem from over-production. Intensive livestock production is dependent on feeding cereals to animals which convert them inefficiently into meat. Intensive production’s demand for cereals has fuelled intensive crop production which has led to soil degradation, water pollution and biodiversity loss. The FAO (2013) warns that further use of cereals as feed could undermine food security. PLF must shift towards supporting systems that provide positive experiences for animals and primarily use animals to convert inedible materials – grass, by-products, food waste – into food we can eat. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

To mainstream PLF, a viable business model needs to be defined in which stakeholders along the supply chain experience added value. A distributed business model for PLF has been developed in the Bright Farm by Precision Livestock Farming (EU-PLF) project. This paper studies the feasibility of this model for broilers and fattening pigs. In the proposed model, the PLF hardware and software is provided by service providers in charge of installation and maintenance, consultancy and reporting. Stakeholders along the supply chain subscribe to “PLF as a service” to get access to data and derived analysis. To confirm the sustainability of a PLF service within a supply chain, a feasibility implementation was tested by estimating the ‘Willingness To Pay/Accept’ (WTP/WTA). Choice experiments were used to evaluate the stakeholder’s WTP/WTA. Analysis results demonstrated that the WTP/WTA of farmers for PLF as a service is generally low. This is most likely due to a lack of success cases and role models for PLF implementations. The remainder of the supply chain, in particular, feed companies and integrators, acknowledge the value of farm data. The current WTP/WTA restricts the possibility of a full-scale implementation in small group pig farms due to the ROI exceeding the useful lifespan of the technology. On the other hand, a full PLF implementation in a poultry chain as a service is considered to be feasible. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Moreover, each animal unit is of a high economical value to the farmer.

Precision livestock farming (PLF) systems offer a real-time monitoring and management tool for the farmer. They provide early warning to the farmer, so when something goes wrong during production, the farmer can immediately act on the information. Precision livestock farming requires real-time algorithms that are able to detect problems while the process is ongoing. To successfully develop such algorithms in an efficient way, some basic principles must be respected in the methodology being applied.

Given the loss of competitiveness of the French poultry production sector in comparison with other major producing countries in Europe, an inventory of poultry buildings showed less specialisation, a modest average size of conventional barns and less modern facilities. Based on these observations, the Mixed Technological Network (""Livestock Buildings of Tomorrow"") has been working on a virtual prototype of a broiler farm in France that can be viable, competitive and modern. Poultry experts working in different specialisms met to define the virtual prototype in terms of the design, construction and use of this future building. New avenues will be explored for next generations of buildings. This paper will focus on the potential contribution of precision livestock farming in achieving energy savings at farm level (efficient insulation, cost-effective lighting, optimum climate control inside the building, air exchangers), minimising the environmental impact (use of a biomass heating device allowing indirect combustion, solar panels) and ensuring the health and welfare of broilers. It also seeks more precise input and production monitoring (feed, water, energy, broiler growth and activity, indoor environmental control) to guarantee the zootechnical performance, health and welfare of broilers. With this prototype building, breeders will be able to implement the necessary combinations to meet specific needs. The recent development of connected management devices should facilitate the introduction of new technologies and the response to the expectations of the poultry sector and society in general. Integration of these new technologies into the current building stock and into the breeder’s knowledge should facilitate professionalisation of rearing facilities, improve the profitability of investments and make livestock breeding attractive to the next generation. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Monitoring of poultry health status plays a key role in farm management by reducing use of chemicals/drugs and their costs. Nowadays, antibiotics are commonly used preventively in intensive farming systems, a practice which could result in antibiotic resistance. For this reason, there is global interest in reducing the use of antimicrobials (AM). This could be achieved through Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), which can provide valuable information for the early detection of health problems in intensive farming by combining cheap technologies and specific algorithms. The experimental trial was carried out in the facilities of the Università degli Studi di Milano located in Lodi. One hundred and twenty Ross 308 one-day-old chicks were divided into two separate boxes (A and B) with standardised management conditions. Air samples from both groups were analysed with a chemical sensor array and processed with multivariate statistical software. This study aims to develop a PLF diagnostic tool which is sensitive to variations in volatile organic compounds for prompt recognition of enteric problems in intensive farming, providing support for veterinarians and enabling specific treatments to be applied in the event of disease.

In this study, the aim was to evaluate the potential of Precision Livestock Farming systems to identify leg problems in broilers. Data were gathered from five different commercial farms in Europe. Leg problems in broilers were assessed on a discrete scale according to the Welfare Quality Protocol by trained local human experts. Bird activity was continuously monitored with a camera-based system in the ridge of the house, mounted in top-down perspective. The camera software analysed the recorded images and calculated the distribution and the activity of the birds in the flock. Bird weight was automatically sampled with an automatic weighing scale in the house. Data analysis showed a linear trend between activity level of the flock on the day of the assessment (ACT) and the average gait score of the flock (GS): = −0.21 ∗ + 2.85 (R 2 =0.55). The negative coefficient implies that higher activity levels are associated with lower gait scores, i.e. better animal gait. Gait score and flock activity are negatively correlated (r=-0.741), whereas gait score and flock distribution are positively correlated (r=0.705). Due to differences in management and broiler breeds, the absolute values in activity level and gait score vary between farms. The linear trend is however clear in all farms (R 2 =[0.53-0.74]). This study showed the potential of a camera-based monitoring tool for flock behaviour analysis as a warning tool for the poultry farmer to detect possible leg problems in commercial farm settings. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

By contrast, one could argue that animal welfare can be better ensured if they are closely monitored with state of the art technology, enabling rapid feedback by the farmer. We will start from the main dimensions of animal welfare, as defined in the Welfare Quality® approach, to analyse how PLF can help to ensure the health and the comfort of animals, to promote appropriate behaviour, and to avoid distress. Examples will be mainly based from our own experience gained by the use of a Real Time Locating System that allows inferring the animal behaviour in real time. Not only the time a given animal spent in each activity or the distance it travels per day can help understanding whether this animal is functioning normally (e.g. spends sufficient amount of time resting or eating, or moves enough) but also the organisation of activities during the day or in relation to specific events (i.e. circadian rhythms, reactions to human approach) can give indications on subtle changes that reflect health or behavioural problems. We do not conclude that PLF is necessary for animal welfare nor that animal welfare is always promoted by PLF techniques but rather that including animal welfare considerations in the development and use of PLF techniques is essential to obtain profit for all: the farmer, the animal, and the society. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

It affects the nature and frequency of their daily tasks, specifically in relation to animals, and the data available about the animals. Consequently, it may affect the quality of the human-animal relationship and how farmers perceive their profession. To better understand these effects, a survey was carried out on 25 French farms raising three different species and equipped with different tools: milking robots and heat detectors for dairy cows, automatic feeders for sows, and electronic controllers and automatic weighing devices for poultry. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the farmers. The main results showed that there were diverse motivations behind the farmers’ decision to install new equipment: some sought better working conditions, others to improve their technical management, yet others were induced by value chain incentives. Most mentioned that their job had become more technical, and the majority were satisfied. Farmers’ interactions with their animals had changed and sometimes decreased, with less time spent in their presence or in direct contact. Digital data enabled a different view of animals, focusing on problematic individuals. Some farmers continued to observe their animals and used specific practices to facilitate work and reduce animal stress, while others delegated decisions and tasks entirely to their equipment. Nevertheless, some farmers noted limits regarding the place of new technologies on a farm, such as the risk of losing their own autonomy or their ability to observe animals and detect problems. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

In addition to the design of adapted feeders, precision feeding requires decision-support tools to manage data and apply nutritional models that calculate the optimal feed composition and allowance. These calculations require to forecast body weight (BW) and feed intake (FI) of individual pigs according to past performance. To select the most accurate forecasting method, three statistical methods were tested on a dataset of measurements of BW and FI for 117 pigs: the double exponential smoothing (DES) method, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and the k-nearest neighbours (kNN) method. These methods were tested in relation to data sampling frequency (i.e., daily or weekly measurements) and data availability. The capacity to forecast BW or FI was evaluated through the mean error of prediction. The kNN method appeared suitable if few historical data are available as it requires not more than 3 historical data. The MARS method was better than the DES method to forecast daily BW, but the DES method was better in forecasting the daily cumulated FI. The DES method also seemed more appropriate for weekly BW data, requiring only 3 historical data to make a forecasting. These methods can be used for performance forecasting in a decision-support tool for precision feeding.

Dairy cattle under heat stress will encounter sub-optimal welfare that can ultimately results in production loss for farmers. In precision livestock farming (PLF), studies aimed at modelling the influence of heat stress have been undertaken for several decades. Mitigation solutions including optimal shed structure, ventilation systems, targeted feeding regimes, improved farm management and genetic selection have also been used widely on farms. However, under different on-farm conditions, the heat tolerance and coping ability of cattle can vary significantly. Until now, the results from different developed models can only provide generalized heat stress thresholds for on-farm use. Similar problems exist in relation to mitigation solutions. This review will summarize current developments and analyse the differences in current on-farm research. The results related to thermal indices, animal responses, production loss and mitigation approaches will be compared and analysed. Instead of conducting large international studies to identify and overcome inconsistencies between different study results, alternative solution may be developed via more robust modelling or programming for specific farm and building systems. The developed model or program should be self-recalibrated based on the real-time collection of information on key parameters. The feasibility of the proposed system will be supported by innovative PLF and information technologies. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Moreover, innovations of a profoundly impactful nature on someone’s daily work processes, such as precision dairy farming, are never adopted solely on financial grounds. For a farmer, new technologies should also adhere to beliefs and perceptions of, for instance, usefulness, reliability, attractiveness, or effect on wellbeing. These factors –together with many others-constitute the so-called ‘user experience’. This is a matter of design, and is closely connected to the most important component of the business model: the value proposition. For creators of precision farming applications, for instance, it is crucial to design in such a way that farmer adoption is most likely, because it is being valued by them. In a current project on precision dairy farming (PDF), research on user experience and the optimal value proposition for PDF applications, has resulted in two guiding tools for PDF application developers: storyboards and user experience design principles.

Farmers need to convert this data into useful, immediate and practical information for farm management and animal welfare. Therefore, in recent years many mathematical models already used in other fields, such as neural networks, image processing, regressions and clustering, have been applied to precision livestock farming. The goal of this study was to develop a clustering method for herd characterisation on dairy farms. Specifically, a cluster-graph approach was applied to a dataset collected through the automatic milking system (AMS) of an Italian dairy farm and containing real-time information for each cow: daily milking frequency, activity, parity, weight, milking frequency, and days of lactation. The clusters were updated every month within the study time span to reflect changes in animal conditions. The results represent a scientific method of transforming the amount of data available on the farm into user-friendly and highly informative data representations, such as graphs and plots, which can provide farmers with valid herd management support, particularly in terms of time and cost optimisation. By comparing subgroups for every single month, clustering can help farmers to take the most appropriate action promptly in order to increase animal welfare and productivity. Integration of the dataset into other farms through new devices and insights is planned in order to further refine the model. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

The new computational analysis uses four features: «steps per day» (dimensionless), «overall walking per day» (m), «lying per day» (min) and «eating per day» (min). The aim of these four features was to help the algorithm to separate the samples, in the best possible way.

In recent years, the public has become increasingly concerned about animal care and well-being. A better understanding of the animal space utilization in current facilities could lead to improved facility design and better animal well-being. This study was conducted to determine whether an active RFID tag tracking system could accurately provide animal locomotion data on an individual animal basis. The system is composed of four sensors, located in the corners of a swine pen, and compact tags, which attach to the animals and transmit a signal. The sensors use the tag signals to determine 3-D positions in real-time. A data acquisition system was developed to capture raw data from the system software into a database for analysis. A single-location test was performed with 34 tags placed in close proximity to a known location, followed by three trials of a second test with 34 tags randomly arranged in a 1-meter by 1-meter grid across the pen. Results from the single-location test were relatively consistent with the manufacturer’s claim of 15-cm accuracy. Error was higher in the grid test, particularly in the Z-direction. The system was used to track four pigs for a period of two days, with visual data analysis showing 84.4% tracking accuracy. Further work revealed that the system is prone to generate large, random jumps in the data that need to be filtered if the desired use is for instantaneous measurements. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

This fact, combined with the changing diets of these people in those countries, will result in an increase of the worldwide demand for animal products (meat, eggs, and milk) of 70% by 2050. Consequently, the number of livestock is increasing, while at the same time, the number of farmers is decreasing. This results in much bigger herds per farmer. It has become impossible for farmers to follow all of their animals in a reliable way in such big groups. At the same time, several issues must be solved now in the livestock sector, such as monitoring animal health and welfare, reducing the environmental impact, and assuring the productivity of the process. Precision livestock farming (PLF) aims to offer a real-time monitoring and managing system for farmers. This is fundamentally different from other approaches that tried to monitor the animal welfare by human experts scoring animal-based indicators. These methods do not improve the life of the animal under consideration. It is nice to detect a problem after an animal has arrived at the slaughterhouse, but it is much better to detect a problem while the animal is being reared and to take immediate management action. The idea of PLF is to provide a real-time warning when something goes wrong so that immediate action can be taken by the farmer to solve the problem. To bring PLF technology further into field application, increased development and testing of PLF technologies is required in real farms to implement reliable solutions. To further develop and introduce such supporting management PLF systems, some basic principles must be respected. © Berckmans.","General introduction to PLF; Principles of PLF",

A trial was set up in a commercial dairy herd with an automatic milking system (AMS). The experimental treatments in terms of three versus ten feed pushes per day were performed twice in one large group of lactating dairy cows during July-August 2015. Mixed models were used to evaluate the effect of the applied feed pushing frequencies on three feed event-based feeding behaviours and three meal-based feeding behaviours, dry matter and energy intake, daily milk yield and milking attendance. Results from this study could not support increasing number of feed pushes in this herd in order to improve production as ten feed pushes did not as expected increase feeding activity of the cows. Instead it resulted in significantly longer duration of feed events, fewer meals and less total meal time compared to three feed pushes per day. Furthermore, feed intake and daily milk yield were significantly lower during experimental periods with ten feed pushes.

In particular, many consultants and farmers have easily misunderstood the ventilation efficiency and internal airflow distribution and wrong judgments have therefore been made. The air flow is the main mechanism of internal environmental distribution for gas, temperature, humidity and dusts; however, as is well known, the airflow is invisible and difficult to predict and measure. Therefore, it is essential to develop training materials to enable farmers to recognize the micro-climate visually. In this study, an aerodynamic approach was adopted using CFD (computational fluid dynamics) in combination with VR (virtual reality) technology. First, a number of research papers, reports, journals and publications on the livestock industry were reviewed to find representative problems in swine houses during the hot and cold seasons in Korea. Open-source CFD, non-commercial software, was then used to compute selected problems and their solutions. The design of the livestock house models was based on the 2009 Korean Standard for swine houses.

SARA is related to poor animal welfare and causes behavioural changes: animals are less active, eat less and spend more time lying. Real-time locating systems and activity measurements could be of great interest in detecting cows which exhibit behavioural modifications related to SARA. We investigated whether an activity monitoring system (CowView, GEA, Germany) based on cow location in the barn can detect an experimentally induced SARA episode. Cow activity was inferred from the cow’s location (eating if near the feeding table, resting if in cubicles, etc.). After an adaptation period on a production diet containing 10% starch, 14 cows (SARA group) were challenged for 15 days with an acidogenic production diet containing 30% starch, before resuming their initial diet. Another 14 cows were maintained on the initial diet throughout the experiment (control group). All 28 cows were monitored with a rumen bolus which measured pH continuously. During the SARA challenge, rumen pH changed and the cows’ activity levels changed drastically. Compared to the controls, SARA cows were significantly less active after morning feeding, and spent more time resting and licking salt blocks during the day. Monitoring systems based on cow activity or their location may thus be useful for detecting cows undergoing SARA episodes.

Supervising all these animals is difficult or even impossible for the farmer. Sensors like microphones can help the farmer by continuously monitoring the productivity of the animals and raising early alarms in the case abnormalities in the house. As regards linking sound to production performance, recent studies indicate that there is an inverse relation between the peak frequency of animal sounds and their weight. This study aims to monitor the frequencies of the vocalisations in a broiler house and compare these to the weight evolution of the chickens. The resulting curves compare different production cycles with the aim to provide the farmer with a tool to compare the performance of the current and previous production cycles. Pre-processing was performed by filtering the data in order to remove the machinery noise. After this the median frequency was extracted from the data. It was found that between day 3 and 25, there was a clear difference in frequency values between a production cycle with heavier birds (lower frequency values) and a production cycle with lighter birds (higher frequency values). Based on these results, there is an indication that the method developed has potential to differentiate between light and heavy flocks in a commercial broiler house. Comparing the different batches using the developed approach can help the farmer to distinguish a good and a bad production cycle early and assist the farmer in adapting his management practice. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Previous studies have shown a significant correlation (P ≤ 0.001) between the frequency of vocalization and the age and weight of broilers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify and validate a model that describes the growth rate of broiler chickens based on the peak frequency of their vocalizations and to explore the possibility to develop a tool capable of automatically detecting the growth of the chickens based on the frequency of their vocalizations during the production cycle. It is part of an overall goal to develop a Precision Livestock Farming tool that assists farmers in monitoring the growth of broiler chickens during the production cycle. In the present study, sounds and body weight were continuously recorded in an intensive broiler farm during 5 production cycles. For each cycle the peak frequencies of the chicken vocalizations were used to estimate the weight and then they were compared with the observed weight of the birds automatically measured using on farm automated weighing devices. No significant difference is shown between expected and observed weights along the entire production cycles; this trend was confirmed by the correlation coefficient between expected and observed weights (r = 96%, P value ≤ 0.001). The identified model used to predict the weight as a function of the peak frequency confirmed that bird weight might be predicted by the frequency analysis of the sounds emitted at farm level. Even if the precision of the weighing method based on sounds investigated in this study has to be improved, it gives a reasonable indication regarding the growth of broilers opening a new scenario in monitoring systems in broiler houses. © 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.","Broiler; Precision Livestock Farming; Sound analysis; Vocalization; Weight","animal; animal husbandry; body weight gain; chicken; growth, development and aging; physiology; procedures; theoretical model; validation study; vocalization; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Chickens; Models, Theoretical; Vocalization, Animal; Weight Gain"

Little is known about the daily work and economic pressure the single farmer is exposed to and what he thinks and feels about the increasingly complex production systems with demanding new control and monitoring technologies such as PLF. In a limited survey based on 21 farm visits (nine pig, five broiler, and seven dairy farms) in 10 EU countries, the knowledge of farmers on options and opportunities of precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies in modern animal production systems was investigated. The farmers were asked by personal free-format interviews face to face on their farms. Most pig and poultry farms were visited in 2014, just after the installation of the PLF technology in the farms and 2016 again after 2 yr of experience. The dairy farms could be visited only once in 2016. All farmers who get sufficient support from the providers developed a positive to very positive attitude to the real-time monitoring PLF systems. This applies for pig, broiler, and cow farms. Broiler farmers were more open to PLF than pig farmers. All farmers emphasized with few exceptions that the personal contact to the animals cannot be replaced by video cameras, but the PLF systems can be of great help in daily life. They enable the farmer to recognize problems significantly earlier than with conventional methods. These techniques are not only helpful and animal friendly, they may also assist to bridge the presently existing gap between producers and consumers by transparency of production. Drawbacks are the relative high prices for PLF equipment, sometimes poor maintenance service by the delivering companies, and the lack of broader experience with the systems in practice. Although one farmer responded after 2 yr of experience with his PLF system that he would not miss it anymore and that he understands his animals much better since he uses PLF monitoring, there is an urgent need for more and wider experiences. It is recommended to further test and develop PLF technologies in demonstration farms under practical conditions. It seems that PLF technologies can play an important role in the development of a future-oriented, sustainable, animal-friendly, and efficient livestock production with healthy animals. © Hartung, Banhazi, Vranken, and Guarino.",,

However, the technical specifications of these systems and the code of the implemented algorithms are seldom included in the literature. The overall aim of this study was to fill these gaps by proposing new open-source software tools, i.e. an algorithm and a classifier, to be adopted in a low-cost automated monitoring system based on accelerometers for discriminating dairy cow behavioural activities. Firstly, a novel algorithm characterised by a linear computational time was used for real-time monitoring and analysis of walking behaviour. An innovative classifier was then proposed to detect cow feeding and standing behavioural activities. Both these software tools were based on statistically defined thresholds computed from accelerometer data acquired during the animals’ daily routine by a new data acquisition system operating with a sampling frequency of 4 Hz. It required simple installation into the building and did not need any preliminary calibration. In this study, an overall algorithm for the recognition of dairy cows’ behavioural activities (i.e., lying, standing, walking, and feeding) was also proposed. With regard to the accuracy of the algorithm for walking, the total error was 9.5% and the relative measurement error ranged between 2.4% and 4.8%. The misclassification rate of the algorithm, which discriminates feeding from standing, was 5.56%. Testing of the whole algorithm for cow behaviour recognition showed relatively lower performance in discrimination of standing from walking. The performance of the data acquisition system was evaluated by the stored data index which achieved 83%. The application of the proposed tools allowed cow behaviour recognition with a high level of accuracy, using low-cost devices and open-source software. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Under this new scenario, farmers need to be provided with tools to manage their farm more efficiently. Currently the health status of small ruminants is monitored by farmers using mostly visual inspection however this become ineffective for larger stock numbers. This piece of work presents a new machine learning algorithm based on autoregressive hidden Markov model to analyse triaxial accelerometer data to classify sheep behavioural patterns. The algorithm creates a model of animal’s activity directly from raw data from the sensors and was specifically design for running on embedded devices. This approach allows the model, when used on the initial healthy animal, to be automatically tuned for each individual which subsequently provides a normal reference for abnormal detection. Finally, a set of experiments were performed where a sheep was fitted with the collar prototype over two days. The animal under study was maintained in a shed with two other sheep. The result of this experiment shows that algorithm achieved an average of 93.40±0.09% accuracy when determining the animals’ activities using only the accelerometer data which is comparable to more computer expensive classifying techniques. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

In addition, wild predators can be counted as substantial thread to the livelihood of farmers and to animal welfare. Modern technology can support stock personnel by tracking animals to decrease labour costs and ensure animal welfare. However, one major limitation is the energy demand of these systems. In a pilot study, we were testing a new low cost radio technology with minimal energy requirements and large range. A GPS tracking device was integrated into collar. Every 30 min the position of the animal can be send through “LoRa” (Long Range, Chirp Spread Spectrum Technology from Semtech Cooperation) Ten collars were deployed in a first pilot study in the Alps on eight sheep, one donkey and a livestock guardian dog. A reception sensitivity above -144 dBm could be reached with the chosen modulation parameters. The propagation simulation, including the mountainous topography in the area of the animals’ home range, predicted an adequate coverage. Therefore, 90% of the position massages were transmitted successfully. In future, data of the integrated 3-D-accelerometers can be used to identify unusual behaviour of the animals for predictive healthcare, estrous detection or alert stock personnel in case a wild predator attack is taking place. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

The aim of this study is to propose methods for measuring three behaviours (lying, standing, and feeding) of dairy cows in barns using neck-mounted accelerometers. Lying, standing, and feeding behaviours of 16 lactating dairy cows were logged for 6 hours with 3D-accelerometers attached to the collar of the cows. The behaviours were simultaneously recorded using visual observation and video recordings as a reference. Different features were extracted from the logged raw data and classification algorithms (K-nearest neighbours, naïve Bayes, and support vector machine) were used to classify the cows’ behaviours. The models allowed excellent classification of the feeding behaviour (precision 93%, sensitivity 98%), followed by lying (precision 83%, sensitivity 96%). Standing was the most difficult behaviour to classify with a maximum precision and sensitivity of 75% and 65%, respectively. These results suggest that neck-mounted accelerometers are promising tools to automatically monitor cows’ behaviours such as feeding time, lying time and lying bouts. Such monitoring could be useful for automatically alerting farmers of cows that need attention, e.g. in order to prevent welfare, health or production problems. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Innovative business models for these service organisations can be based upon inter-company data exchange. The adoption of data-driven innovations often requires upfront investments. Furthermore, beyond financial means, it also requires change within organisations, for example, because employees need to be trained on the innovation. This can make the adoption of an innovation difficult. The required changes can be regarded as either barriers or accelerators; barriers might form bottlenecks in further adoption of an innovation, whereas accelerators help to stimulate adoption. It is therefore pivotal to gain insight into the barriers and accelerators in the organisational adoption process. Several workshops with different stakeholders of the dairy farming value chain were held to identify barriers and accelerators for the adoption of a technology that facilitates sharing and combining dairy farming related data (the InfoBroker). Different barriers and accelerators were uncovered. An important accelerator is the expectation to gain a competitive advantage with data-based models. An important barrier is that there are a lot of perceived insecurities in the process to come to data driven services. The factors were plotted on an existing model for innovation adoption. The model was then extended on the basis of the findings in the workshops. The identified barriers and accelerators can be translated into measures to, on the one hand, overcome those barriers and, on the other hand, utilise the accelerators. Examples are: providing decision makers and users of the innovation with the most relevant and persuasive information, and establishing precise requirements for employee training. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Habituation to the laneway, pellets and manual collars occurred 2 x per day for 4 days prior to testing. Testing was performed in a laneway for 4 days. A VF line was set before a feed trough with pellets at the end of the laneway, and moved 10m closer to the holding yard each day for 3 days. Cows received an audio cue for 1 sec at the fence line. If they kept moving forward they received a mildly aversive electric shock. After 3 tests the VC was removed and the test repeated. Animal behaviour, and number of cues received was recorded. The visual cue reduced the number of times cows tested the fence line, with VC cows receiving less cues (mean 2.13) than VF cows (mean 4) overall (P=0.007). The number of cues reduced with each test (P<0.001), however increased with removal of the VC. The VC group received the most cues when the VC was removed (P<0.001). There is variation in response and learning of a VF, and results indicate that a visual cue is does not improve learning of associated cues. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Walk over Weigh (WoW) systems remotely monitor animal weight and radio frequency identification tags. WoW systems exhibit great potential in extensive systems for herd and feed management due to the versatility of their potential application (i.e. weight trends, calving, maternal lineage) and relative implementation ease. They are especially useful where producers cannot regularly monitor animals and the landscapes due to time and geographical constraints, for example in northern Australia. Weight data recorded by a WoW can be inaccurate because of animal behaviour. Inaccurate weight may be recorded when an animal is running or when multiple animals are on a WoW platform at once. Preliminary research to determine if accelerometers could be used to filter out inaccurate weight data in a herd of beef cattle was conducted. A tri-axial accelerometer was mounted on a TRU-TEST™ WOW!™ platform to monitor movement and duration of cattle on the platform. WoW records were compared to conventional weights (traditional monitoring) and visual surveillance of animal’s behaviour when travelling over the scales. Behaviours monitored included running, walking, single and multiple animals. Analysis was undertaken using R ® , which showed the minimum, maximum and mean duration of cattle on the WoW platform differed for the four behaviours monitored. Data recorded from running and multiple animals were distinguishable. This initial study highlights the potential to integrate automatic analysis into WoW systems to improve the quality of data available to producers. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

In this context, increased automation offers possibilities to serve fresh feed at a higher frequency to motivate cows to have more meals and eat more feed. A trial was set up in a commercial dairy herd where each of two experimental treatments was applied twice to two groups of lactating cows. The treatments included (1) partially mixed ration (PMR) divided into six servings of equal size per day (one every four hours) and (2) PMR divided into twelve servings of equal size per day (one every two hours). Every experimental period lasted seven days and was preceded by a seven days transition period with the new feeding out frequency applied. Mixed models were used to evaluate the effect of the experimental treatments on three feed event-based feeding behaviours and three meal-based feeding behaviours, dry matter and energy intake, daily milk yield and number of milkings. In this study, feeding the PMR divided into twelve servings per day resulted in a small but significant increase in average daily feed intake per cow. The feed was consumed during more feed events and meals, however, of shorter duration and shorter total feed time. In short, cows ate more in less time with twelve feed deliveries. The increase in feed intake and change in feeding behavior did not convert into increased milk attendance or milk production as we found no effect of feeding frequency on number of milkings per day or daily milk yield. Group, parity, days in milk and repetition included in the statistical models proved to be important factors for most of the response variables. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Consistent handling of large amounts of data has created a need to improve the data stream analysis process and to use new tools for analysis and visualisation of information. These tools could be a valuable support for farmers in herd management and for researchers in the analysis of animal behavioural activities. In this context, a software tool for automatic and real-time analysis of cow location data acquired by an ultra-wide band real-time location system (UWB RTLS) in a free-stall barn was designed and developed. The main functionality of this tool was a user-interface feature which provided a visual representation through a colour map of the frequency of two-dimensional cow position data (CowHeatMap). In this functionality, the different colour and colour intensity denoted the difference in sample density at a location. The feasibility of the software tool for visualisation and analysis of UWB data was assessed. A use case of this software tool was carried out to verify its suitability for acquisition of useful information related to the occurrence of cow oestrus. The results showed that a behavioural pattern related to the cow oestrus status could be identified from the CowHeatMap and that the area of the house involved in the motor activity of the cow increased from 16.42% to 45.78% during the cow’s feeding time and from 11.33% to 37.30% during the lying time. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

The first trial involved 72 sows penned on a slatted floor in a dynamic group with connected drinkers and automatic feeders, whereas the second trial was carried out on 4 small groups of 6 sows penned on a concrete floor with straw and fed in individual stalls. Firstly, an algorithm was built from video recordings of 24 sows on the slatted floor (2 x 2 h sequences per sow, 96 h). Secondly, the accuracy of the algorithm was assessed by recording and sequencing 96 h and 109 h, respectively, on the slatted floor and concrete floor with straw. The respective sensitivities of the lying, standing and moving behaviours on the slatted floor were 94.4%, 66.9% and 68.4%. With straw, lower sensitivity values were found: 93.65% for lying, 68.35% for standing and 38.83% for moving, linked to more investigative behaviours using the head. The final step was to use these data to improve the feeding practices of pregnant sows, taking their activity level into account. The strong inter- and intra-individual variability shown in the physical activity is a limiting factor for detection of health problems, such as lameness, through the accelerometers. Thus we need additional information, especially the behaviour data generated by identified drinkers and automatic feeders. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

This model is based on the assumption that changes in body weight are closely related to dry matter intake through two components: short-term changes in digestive content related to ingestion and long-term changes in body reserves, which are linked to the cumulative energy balance of the cow since calving. The energy balance results from the difference between the energy inputs from the ingested quantities and the energy requirements related to milk production. The model was tested in a trial with 65 cows receiving the same complete ration during the first 18 weeks of lactation. Observed individual intake was predicted well by the model, with average weekly errors of 2.3 kg, although the daily errors are still high (SD = 3.31 kg). Intake prediction during the first month of lactation showed a systematic bias and further investigation will be necessary to understand this bias and correct it. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

The RFID system can identify and register the pigs’ visits at the trough, the drinkers and a playing device. It is therefore possible to monitor a large part of the behaviour repertoire of each individual pig. Due to the strong connection of behaviour to the health status, different approaches to detect illnesses, focusing on lameness, through the behavioural data of the UHF-RFID system were tested. Along with the daily duration at the different hotspots, the possible ranking order and the social network of the pigs was examined. Results show changings in the feeding behaviour and social relationships of lame pigs, but also the difficulties due to the high intra- and inter-animal variability of the behaviour and the interaction of different parameters. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Technological developments in the areas of networking devices, sensors and communication technology can play a significant role in the sustainability of animal products. In particular, the blockchain has attracted considerable attention as a technology with disruptive applications in many different domains. The blockchain consists of a distributed database which maintains a continuously-growing list of data records, secured from tampering and revision thanks to algorithmic procedures. This paper therefore discusses the potential for establishing a conceptual framework for an animal product supply-chain traceability system based on blockchain technology, in order to enhance food safety and quality and significantly reduce losses during the logistics process. This approach covers the whole data gathering and information management process for every link in the animal product supply chain, including monitoring, tracing and traceability management for quality and safety of the animal product “from farm to fork”. Specifically, the study considers supply chains with different levels of complexity and analyses strengths, weaknesses, limits and opportunities in the implementation of this new technique. The study also shows possible benefits related to both direct supply chains (one supplier to one customer) and multi-entry-exit chains (multiple suppliers to multiple customers). © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

These monitoring systems have potential as data generation tools to guide livestock management; however, information about relationships between health and performance variables and feeding behaviour variables is lacking. To address this shortage, data from a cohort of cattle observed using a feed intake monitoring system were used to characterize relationships between respiratory disease, average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion (GF), feed intake (DMI), feeding time (DMIt), and feeding rate (DMIr). Data from 265 calves fed using a Growsafe® feed intake monitoring system for approximately 70 days were used. Pearson correlation statistics were calculated to describe relationships between continuous performance variables (ADG,GF) and feeding parameters (DMI, DMIt, DMIr). One way analysis of variance was used to assess the impact of respiratory disease on DMI, DMIt, and DMIr. DMI was strongly correlated with ADG (Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient [PCC]=0.68, p<0.0001). DMIt and DMIr were very weakly correlated with ADG (PCC=0.14, p=0.023; PCC=0.18, p=0.004; respectively). Calves with respiratory disease had reduced ADG (0.22 kg less, p<0.0001), decreased DMI (0.5 kg less, p<0.0001), and DMIr (0.9 g/s less, p=0.008) compared to healthy calves. Feeding time did not differ between calves treated for respiratory disease and untreated calves. These data show that feeding behaviour is significantly associated with health and performance of calves at high risk of respiratory disease. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

In this study, we assessed whether pasture intake of individual grazing cattle could be estimated from time spent exhibiting behaviours as determined from data generated by on-animal sensor devices. Variation in pasture intake was created by providing Angus steers (n≤10, mean±s.d. liveweight 650±77kg) with differing amounts of concentrate supplementation during grazing within individual ryegrass plots (≤0.22ha). Pasture dry matter intake (DMI) for the steers was estimated from the slope (kgDMday-1) of the regression of total pasture DM per plot on intake over an 11-day period. Pasture DM in each plot, commencing with ≤2tDMha-1, was determined by using repeatedly calibrated pasture height and electronic rising plate meters. The amounts of time spent grazing, ruminating, walking and resting were determined for the 10 steers by using data from collar-mounted, inertial measurement units and a previously developed, highly accurate, behaviour classification model. An initial pasture intake algorithm was established for time spent grazing: pasture DMI (kg day-1)≤-4.13+2.325×hours spent grazing (P≤0.010, r2≤0.53, RSD≤1.65kgDMday-1). Intake algorithms require further development, validation and refinement under varying pasture conditions by using sensor devices to determine specific pasture intake behaviours coupled with established methods for measuring pasture characteristics and grazing intake and selectivity. © CSIRO 2017.","accelerometer; acoustic sensor; GPS; herbivores; magnetometer","accelerometer; algorithm; cattle; electronic equipment; genetic engineering; GPS; grazing management; herbivore; livestock farming; magnetometer; measurement method; pasture; regression analysis; sensor; Animalia; Bos; Lolium"

For sensor manufacturers, it is important to realize that uncertainty about future technological progress may influence the adoption of sensors. The aim of the current study was to explain why dairy farmers do not (yet) adopt sensors on their farms. To explain this, the uncertainty of the investment decision for highly adopted sensors (automated estrus detection) and recently released and thus hardly adopted sensors (automated body condition scoring (BCS)) was illustrated. The illustration makes use of the real options theory to analyze the timing of investment decisions. The results indicated that investing now in automated estrus detection resulted in higher economic returns than investing 5 years from now, while for the automated BCS postponing the investment resulted in higher economic returns compared to investing now. These results show that farmers indicating that they did not (yet) invest in sensors because they are waiting for improved versions made rational decisions. Based on the illustration it is economically worthwhile to postpone investments in sensors for which there is much uncertainty. Also, the current high adoption of automated estrus detection sensors is logical because the net present value of investing now is higher than the net present value of investing in 5 years. This study illustrated that uncertainty about the benefits of a sensor system, potential future improvement of sensor technology, and expected better management information from a sensor system, form rational economic reasons to postpone investment in sensor systems. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

The technology is attractive for reasons of resource management and animal welfare in dairy production. The objective of the present study was to support this technology in terms of methodologies for automated classification of behaviors that are essential for detection of lameness, estrus, emissions, and feed and water consumption. A multistage support vector machine (MSVM) classification model was constructed to recognize the behavioral patterns of three dairy cows based on 44 features reflecting the dynamics in data. Each cow was fitted with a neck collar comprising a combination of a three-axis accelerometer with a measure range of ±2 g, and a three-axis magnetometer with a measuring range of ±1.3 gauss. The recognized behavioral patterns were: ‘Lying’, ‘Upright’ and ‘Ruminating’, with upright divided into the subclasses: ‘Standing’, ‘Walking’, ‘Feeding’, ‘Drinking’. The classification model achieved recognition of the main classes: ‘Lying’ (89% sensitivity, 86% precision), ‘Upright’ (81%, 84%). and ‘Rumination’ (98%, 97%), The classification model achieved recognition of the subclasses: ‘Standing’ (86%, 86%), ‘Walking’ (14%, 53%), ‘Feeding’ (91%, 84%) and ‘Drinking’ (17%, 64%). Limited number of observations and uncertain annotation of the classes: ‘Walking’ and ‘Drinking’, resulted in poor performance for these classes. The transitions between ‘Lying’ and ‘Upright’ were also registered, but omitted in the analysis, since the duration of these resulted in very few observations. This study introduced a multistage SVM classification model and refined the features compared to previous and similar studies using SVM. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Generally the strategy is to feed cattle until costs for that day exceed the gain in value, that is, the marginal net revenue becomes negative. If a business owns many pens of cattle, the objective is to maximize profit of all pens over time; the economic principle is to feed each pen until marginal net revenue no longer exceeds the average daily net revenue for the replacement pen. However, complex interactions between type of cattle, markets, and application of marketing and management tools make profit prediction difficult. To address this, the beef cattle simulation module in UC software TAURUS is employed to dynamically predict animal value. This method integrates the biology of the animal, its management, and market prices to project animal and carcass characteristics through time, and associated costs and potential revenue. Results show an interaction between frame size and optimal feeding period, with larger frame cattle benefiting from earlier age at feedlot entry, or smaller frame cattle benefiting by being grown on forage diets or pastures before feedlot entry. If cattle are bought at low and sold at high prices, then average daily revenue is greater, and cattle are fed shorter times. Also, if average daily net revenue is projected to decrease after a set of cattle may be sold, that set of cattle should be fed longer. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

A special connected drinker was developed to collect this type of data. It is composed of an anti-wastage bowl drinker surrounded by shoulder partitions, a precision water meter (± 0.01 l for piglets and ± 0.1 l for sows) and a RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) antenna to detect animals near the drinker by means of the individual electronic ear tag on each pig. Observations on animals were carried out twice a week to evaluate their health status. This study only focuses on healthy animals. Weaned piglets were bred in pens of 19 animals. The individual water consumption was 10.7% of body weight on average. Sows were bred in a dynamic group equipped with 6 connected drinkers and automatic feeders. On average, the daily water consumption was 8.2 l/day (1.6 l during the meal and 6.6 l directly at the bowl drinker). For the two types of animal, there is large inter- and intra-individual variability in terms of water consumption (more than 30%). Thus, it appears to be difficult to determine the health status of piglets or sows on the basis of drinking behaviour only. The next step is to combine this information with other data (feeding system, automatic weighing station, accelerometer, etc.) to identify a behavioural pattern in healthy animals. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

In this context, the availability of new technologies for high throughput phenotyping of sows and their environment, and of innovative feeders that allow the distribution of different diets, offers opportunities for a renewed and practical implementation of prediction models of nutrient requirements, in the perspective of improving feed efficiency and reducing feeding costs and environmental impacts. The objective of this study was thus to design a decision support tool that could be incorporated in automated feeding equipment. The decision support tool was developed on the basis of InraPorc® model. The optimal supply for a given sow is determined each day according to a factorial approach considering all the information available on the sow: genotype, parity, expected prolificacy, gestation stage, body condition (i.e. weight and backfat thickness), activity and housing (i.e. type of floor and ambient temperature). The approach was tested using data from 2500 pregnancies on 540 sows. Energy supply was calculated for each sow to achieve, at farrowing, a target body weight established based on parity, age at mating and backfat thickness (18 mm). Precision feeding (PF) with the mixing of two diets was then simulated in comparison with conventional (CF) feeding with a single diet. Compared to CF, PF reduced protein and amino-acid intake, N excretion and feeding costs. At the same time, with PF, amino acid requirement was met for a higher proportion of sows, especially in younger sows, and a lower proportion of sows, especially older sows, received excessive supplies. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, grant agreement No 633531.

In this study, a new and open source algorithm, characterised by a linear computational time, was defined and implemented with the aim to improve real-time monitoring and analysis of walking behaviour of dairy cows. It was applied to a novel inertial sensor-based system composed of low-cost devices, including wearable sensors, open source software, operating with a 4-Hz sampling frequency. The algorithm computed the number of steps of each cow from accelerometer data by making use of statistically defined thresholds. Two vector variables were considered to study the accelerometer signals, i.e., Signal Vector Magnitude and Signal Magnitude Area. Algorithm accuracy was carried out by comparing total error (E) and Relative Measurement Error (RME), and a sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the computed thresholds was carried out to analyse the variation of the error made by the algorithm. The results showed that the algorithm produced an E equal to 9.5%, and a RME between 2.4% and 4.8%. The sensitivity analysis confirmed that the proposed thresholds provided the minimum errors and that RME is less suitable than E for measuring the accuracy of the step counter. In fact, the underestimated and overestimated numbers of steps counted by the algorithm tended to compensate each other in RME computation. © 2016 IAgrE","Cow behaviour; Dairy farming; Precision livestock farming; Step counter","Accelerometers; Agriculture; Computer vision; Errors; Inertial navigation systems; Information dissemination; Open source software; Open systems; Real time systems; Sensitivity analysis; Software engineering; Wearable technology; Accelerometer signals; Computational procedures; Cow behaviour; Dairy farming; Monitoring and analysis; Precision livestock farming; Sampling frequencies; Step-counter; Wearable sensors"

One shows how failure to involve a statistician at the beginning of a project resulted in considerable waste of resources. Subsequent engagement of professional statisticians with rigorous experimental design and analysis led to greatly increased precision in the standard error of an estimate for the digestible energy content of cereal grains for pigs from ± 0.35 MJ/kg to ± 0.16 MJ/kg.

Therefore, the objective was to develop an electronic method of obtaining pig weights through depth images. Seven hundred and seventy-two images and weights were acquired from four different ages (8, 12, 16, and 21 weeks) of finishing pigs (a mix of gilts and barrows) of three sire-lines (Landrace, Duroc and Yorkshire). Weights ranged from 10.8 – 125.7 kg. The images were analysed using the MATLAB image processing toolbox and summing the columns to calculate the volume. Sixty percent of the data was used for equation development, and 40% was used for testing. Individual equations for weight predictions by volume were developed for gilts and barrows and for the three sire-lines. A global equation using the combined data was developed and then compared with individual equations using the Efroymson’s algorithm. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the global equation and the individual equations for barrows and gilts (p<0.05), and the global equation was also not different from individual equations for each of the sire lines (p<0.05). In addition, the results from the global equation indicate that volume accounted for 99.05% of the variation in weight. Using the test data set, the global equation predicted weights using volume calculated with an average error of 4.6% or 2.2 kg. Therefore, the results of this study show that the depth sensor would be a reasonable approach to continuously monitor weights. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Additionally, weather data (temperature, humidity) were retrieved from the Dutch National Weather Service (KNMI). The 2014 data (245 cows; 277 parities) were used for model development. The first model (M1) applied an existing formula to estimate energy requirement using parity, fat and protein corrected milk, and live-weight, and assumed this requirement to be equal to energy intake and thus FI. The second model used ‘traditional’ Mixed Linear Regression, first using the same variables as in M1 as fixed effects (MLR1), and then by adding weather data (MLR2). The third model applied Boosted Regression Tree, a ‘modern’ machine learning technique, again once with the same variables as M1 (BRT1), and once with weather information added (BRT2). All models were validated on 2015 data (155 cows; 165 parities) using correlation between estimated and actual FI to evaluate performance. Both MLRs had very high correlations (0.91) between actual and estimated FI on 2014 data, much higher than 0.46 for M1, and 0.73 for both BRTs. When validated on 2015 data, correlations dropped to 0.71 for MLR1 and 0.72 for MLR2, and increased to 0.71 for M1 and 0.76 for both BRTs. FI estimated by BRT1 was, on average, 0.35kg less (range: -7.61 – 13.32kg) than actual FI compared to 0.52kg less (range: -11.67 – 19.87kg) for M1.

In this paper, the first results are presented of an automated warning system that is based on measurements of the feeding pattern. The system is able to give real-time alarms for individual fattening pigs. A validated High Frequency Radio Frequency Identification (HF RFID) system was used to measure the feeding pattern of each pig. Using this data, a warning system was developed with time-varying individual control limits using the concept of Synergistic Control. Synergistic Control is the synergy between the models used in Engineering Process Control (EPC) and the control charts used in Statistical Process Control (SPC). During a validation round, 140 pigs were observed closely and individually by observers to identify true alarms, false alarms and problems missed by the warning system. Using this system, 58.3% of the days where a problem was present in individual pigs were detected and 71.0% of the alarms were correct. Severe problems were detected within 1.4 days on average. The SGC approach gave better results than a fixed group limit. Further improvements in sensitivity and precision are still needed, as well as tests to compare the performance to the farmers’ observation. But overall, the system allows better detection and follow-up of individual pigs’ problems, which would in turn increase the pigs’ health, welfare and productivity, improve labour efficiency and help with decision making. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Grass is currently allocated based on a combined calculation of either grass height measurements or estimates and grass quality estimations. However, the recommended measurement procedures are time and labour demanding and estimates are subjective. The aim of this study was to evaluate if cow feeding and activity behaviour, measured by an automated noseband sensor and pedometer, could be used to identify different levels of feed availability in a pasture-based system. Control cows were offered 100 % of their intake capacity as herbage allowance (Control) throughout a 10-week experimental period, while treatment cows were offered 60 % of the herbage allowance of the control cows (Treatment) for a 2-week or 6-week period in spring-time. Rumination behaviour (rumination time/day and chews/bolus) as well as bite frequency were significantly affected by the restricted feeding regimen. Thus, a change in feeding behaviour was observed when the herbage allowance was restricted. This indicated that feeding behaviour may represent a suitable indicator of insufficient grass allocation. Decision support based on monitoring cow behaviour can be indicative of insufficient grass allocation and may allow improved management of pasture based milk production systems. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Current observation-based estrus detection practices are labor intensive and less accurate. Around estrus, body temperature and activity change. Therefore in this study a telemetric monitoring system for body temperature and activity was tested. Firstly Templant2 sensors (TeleMetronics) were validated under lab conditions for temperatures from 35°C to 45°C, using a water basin with a Julabo heater and a P600 thermometer. Activity measurements were validated with the sensors attached to a stick, simulating sow movements. Secondly, sensors were attached externally to 4 gilts and 4 sows for 30 minutes, testing functionality. Thirdly, activity of sows was recorded manually for 3 days around estrus. Results showed that under lab conditions temperature results of sensors, heater and thermometer were highly correlated (linear regression, R 2 =0,96; slope 1,1). Simulated activities corresponded consistently with peaks in sensor values. Activity was measured reliably with the sensor attached externally to the sows. On the farm, sows showed more activity (manual observations, P&lt;0.05 for standing up, lying down, sitting down and walking) the day before insemination. We conclude that monitoring activity and body temperature is a promising tool for estrous detection in sows. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Whilst aspects of reduced health are recorded, much data is missed. Here lies an opportunity to use veterinary health data to improve herd health and biosecurity in both Australia and Europe. A survey on Australian veterinarian data collection, use and reporting was compiled, tested and emailed to members of the Australian Cattle Veterinarian’s Association. The survey was focused on veterinarians with dairy farmers as clients. Results revealed that 86% of veterinarians created a report from their consultation, primarily on a specific computer programme (71%), with individual animal ID recorded 75% of the time. Reproductive issues, mastitis and lameness were the top 3 animal health issues; however, 89% of veterinarians identified undiagnosed cases of reduced health. 83% of veterinarians held the data within their practice without sharing with state organisations or other veterinary practices. However, 71% of respondents were willing to share data with a centralised database provided a streamlined process was in place. The centralised system would therefore need to be automated to minimise time input.

In the last fifty years, manual measurement has been the most straightforward way of evaluating animal body parameters. However, this approach is laborious and may be stressful for both the cows and the stockman. In the present work, Structure from Motion (SfM) was studied and proposed as a low-cost and non-invasive technique for three-dimensional reconstruction of the cow body. Analyses carried out on a fibreglass model clearly show how SfM has the potential to provide a high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction, which can be used for quantitative extraction of body parameters. The approach was implemented to get rid of cow movements, based on a segmented approach where different portions of the body were imaged during different frame acquisition tasks, focused firstly on the top and secondly on the sides. Experimental tests demonstrated how body portions ranging between 20 and 40% of the whole cow area could be properly reconstructed, thus providing an adequate data set for extraction of body indices. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Because milking requires permanent access to the robot, cows cannot graze in paddocks which are a long way from the AMS or separated by roads. Moving the AMS might be a solution to maintaining grazing in these contexts. Therefore, two experimental farms, Liège in Belgium and Trévarez in Brittany, France, chose to design a mobile AMS by placing it on a trailer. This trailer is inside the cowshed during winter and on a grassland summer site during 6 months of the year. Two grass management systems were studied over 3 to 6 years, allocating two or three paddocks per 24h (systems AB and ABC). The impact of these different systems on animal performance, cow traffic, grass usage, working time and feeding costs was assessed. These two experimental farms show that it is possible to use a mobile milking robot, with the moving time for the robot, cows and drafting gate limited to 15 man-hours in total, the AMS being out of use for just 3 to 4 hours. High grass usage and good traffic to the robot were obtained in both the AB and the ABC systems with limited human intervention. However, the investment cost of such solutions remains relatively high and must be balanced by decreased feeding costs. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

In this study a multivariate dynamic linear model (DLM) is developed based on data from simultaneous monitoring of water consumption across multiple pens in two separate herds. The two herds consist of a commercial finisher herd (Herd A) and a research farm with weaners (Herd B). Parameters in the model can be defined individually at herd, section or pen level. This spatial distinction allows early warnings to be generated at pen level or merged at section or herd level to reduce the number of alarms. Information on which specific pens or sections are of higher risk of stress or diseases is communicated to the farmer and target work effort to pens at risk. For Herd A, all model parameters defined at section level resulted in the best fit (MSE = 13.85 litres 2 /hour). For Herd B, parameters defined at both pen and section level resulted in the best fit (MSE = 1.47 litres 2 /hour). For both Herd A and Herd B, preliminary results support the spatial approach by generating a reduced number of alarms when comparing section levels to pen levels.

They are equipped with high performance inertial measurement units (IMU) and absolute positioning systems analyzing users' movements, but they can easily be diverted to analyze likewise the behaviors of domestic animals such as cattle. The study of animal behavior using smartphones requires the storage of many high frequency variables from a large number of individuals and their processing through various relevant variables combinations for modeling and decision-making. Transferring, storing, treating and sharing such an amount of data is a big challenge. In this paper, a lambda cloud architecture and a scientific sharing platform used to archive and process high-frequency data are proposed. An application to the study of cattle behavior on pasture on the basis of the data recorded with the IMU of iPhones 4S is exemplified. The package comes also with a web interface to encode the actual behavior observed on videos and to synchronize observations with the sensor signals. Finally, the use of fog computing on the iPhone reduced by 42% on average the size of the raw data by eliminating redundancies. © 2017 The Authors.

One area of focus of this network is how genetic and genomic tools can be used to breed animals that are less likely to develop damaging behaviour to their pen-mates. When focussing on laying hens, one of the main problems is that feather pecking (FP) occurs in large groups, making it difficult to identify birds performing damaging behaviour. We propose a combination of sensor technology and genomic methods to solve this issue. Research on genetic lines selected divergently on high and low FP as well as on a F2 cross established from these lines has pointed to mechanisms that may underlie this behaviour, revealing relationships between FP, fearfulness and activity levels and locating genomic markers related with FP. Birds selected for high FP were found to be less fearful and highly active in a range of tests and home pen situations. This knowledge may be used to automatically detect high feather-pecking individuals in a group setting. Research on using novel methods such as ultra-wideband tracking to detect phenotypic differences between individuals in a group is ongoing. First results confirm previously found line differences in fearfulness and activity. Future work will focus on exploring potential of other sensor-based methods to accurately measure individual phenotypes, and linking this information to genomic markers. This should lead to the development of novel breeding methods to select against damaging behaviour in laying hens. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems have been successfully used in animal facilities and research has identified potential applications in behaviour monitoring for automated problem detection. Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF), and Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) are the three frequency ranges most commonly used. The objective of this paper is to compare and evaluate the application of these three different RFID systems within grow-finish swine facilities in terms of hardware characteristics, system design, and data processing and usage. Differences in tag construction, availability and cost are evident, but also basic differences in reader and antenna function, such as physics of data exchange, speed of detection, and anti-collision procedures exist. The systems can have significant differences in read ranges and also showed varying influence of materials, especially water and metal, on the performance of the systems. However, the data streams as well as methods of data processing and the creation of events (e.g. visits to a feeder) are similar for all systems. The characteristics mentioned do not necessarily identify an ideal RFID technology, but reveal positive and negative aspects of each system. The three different RFID systems have been successfully applied in pig facilities. Current research is focussed on the utilisation of the RFID data in prediction and decision models for illness, animal welfare and management actions. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Sensor data (measuring activity and behaviour) and extensive reference data were collected for a group of 22 dairy cows during a period from 2 weeks prior to expected parturition until 6 weeks after parturition. During this period the cows were scored daily for health status. The number of days of diminished health (DDH) were used a health measure of a cow.

Correlations with variances were significant (*) for ear temperature and number of steps. Correlations with autocorrelations were not significant. Correlations with nonperiodicity were significant for eating time (*), number of steps (**), motion index (**) and lying time (***); where nonperiodicity was defined as the mean squared error of the correlogram with a sinusoid with a 24h cycle and an amplitude of 0.25.

Our objective was to identify biometric indicators of the level of piglet maturity using external body length measurements. Dead piglets were fixed on a board to be photographed in a standardised way. Images were subsequently analysed using ImageJ software (Abramoff et al., 2004). Measurements included body length, body width, body surface, head surface, skull length, head length and head width. In addition, it was possible to measure humerus, femur, tibia and foot lengths because these bones were clearly visible through the skin. Body measurements enabled us to compare allometric development of 312 progeny from contrasting breeds for maturity at birth: the Meishan (MS) and the Large White (LW). A crossbreeding design with use of mixed semen from the two breeds enabled us to study differences in development between purebreds (PB) and crossbreds (CB) developing in a LW or a MS uterine environment. Similar allometric slopes (>0.70) for body width and femoral length relative to body length were found at 90d dvp in LW PB and MS PB, but null slopes observed at 110d dvp in MS PB indicated a slowing of development. Head development did not differ between genetic types. In conclusion, body development was slower in MS PB than in other genetic types in late gestation, indicating that full body development was reached in MS PB only. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

The objective of this work was to develop a model based on artificial neural networks (neural model) to estimate the rectal temperature of beef cattle through the body surface infrared temperature measured with embedded low-cost sensors. Experiments were performed with two groups of Nellore cattle confined in different periods. For development of the neural model, the inputs were infrared thermographic images collected from the face surface of animals and the air temperature and humidity. The neural model was based on a multi-layer non-feedback architecture and used supervised learning. Subsequently, the model generated was tested with inputs from low-cost embedded sensors: an infrared pyrometer and a digital sensor which supplied the air temperature and humidity. In the model generation step, the statistical analysis of the measured and estimated rectal temperature showed a correlation coefficient of 0.85. In the second step, the neural model fed with embedded sensor data showed a correlation coefficient of 0.69. The results strengthen the potential for generalisation of the neural model and validate its application as a means of estimating the rectal temperature of animals based on embedded low-cost sensors. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

This results in a fatigue of the teat tissue, especially the teat skin, and can lead to teat damages. The aim of this study was to test the usability of the suction method for teat skin elasticity measurements to get a better understanding of the teat liner interface. The usability of the different measuring traits was analysed as well. The Cutometer ® dual MPA 580 is a tool to detect the elasticity of the skin and several skin layers with the help of suction. It was used to investigate the teat skin elasticity of the right rear teats from 101 randomly selected cows. Measurements were carried out in a side-by-side milking parlour before and after milking using the measuring mode 1 of the Cutometer ® dual MPA 580. Penetration depth of the skin, gross elasticity, net elasticity, ratio of immediate retraction to total distension and difference in maximal skin deformation between the last and the first suction were analysed. Descriptive statistics of all traits were calculated. Based on the results of our study we concluded that the Cutometer ® dual MPA 580 is generally usable to measure teat skin elasticity.

A data set comprising continuous measurements of particulate concentrations, ventilation rate, broiler activity, mortality and weight over 14 batches at a modern broiler farm was used to test the hypothesis. Typically dust concentration increased with increasing activity, with peak values in activity and dust concentration due to dawn or feed events coinciding. A good correlation between particulate matter and activity was found for any 24hr period (0.6), but the correlation for a full crop was substantially lower at 0.39. Modelling the relationship between dust concentration and bird activity, required for adaptive control of ventilation rate, proved difficult. Transfer function models, often used for control purposes, were not suitable as the order of the model, as well as the values of the model parameters changed from day to day. A dynamic linear model approach functioned better with a mean relative prediction error of 10% for a prediction horizon of 2 minutes, based upon a time window of 30 minutes. However, both models required regular real time measurement of the aerosol concentration, to re-estimate the model parameters, thus to avoid deviation from the true value.

Changing the own body posture to free trapped piglets is part of the natural behaviour repertoire of sows. However, up to 40% of the sows did not show this behaviour in replay studies using piglet dummies and pre-recorded screams. Actively stimulating posture changes in non-reacting sows using aversive stimulations might decrease the risk of lethal crushing. The present study investigated whether the detection of stress articulation through vocalisation analysis would be sufficient to identify trapped piglets. It also investigated the effectiveness of different context filters to improve the detection performance. For this purpose 20 sows were monitored with directional microphones, light barriers for posture detection and event controlled video recordings. The results show, that trapping related stress articulations were outnumbered by other stress articulations of piglets by a factor of 1:140 in a farrowing compartment with 4 sows per trial run. Most stress articulation was detected in the context of nursing in the monitored and neighbouring pens. By filtering the articulation with respect to the current posture of the sow, the age of its piglets and the duration since the last posture change, the ratio between trapping and other stress events could be reduced to 1:3. Hence, vocalisation analysis alone would be insufficient to safely trigger posture changes, but could be feasible in combination with context filters. Compared to pens with farrowing cage, timed aversive stimulations would limit the impairment of welfare to only those individuals that crush piglets and to the time of crushing events. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

The system, when used in practical farm conditions, should support the farm staff in reducing the problems of mortality in piglets due to perinatal asphyxia and crushing. The experiments took place in the research farm of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, using a herd of 120 Large White sows. Data were collected from sows housed in farrowing pens with possibility of temporary crating. The farrowing process of 8 sows was video recorded and labelled for a period of 6 hours (h) before the start of farrowing until the end of farrowing. Timestamps of births of all piglets in the litter were labelled. Images obtained during the experiment were segmented with focus on piglet detection. Three parameters were extracted from segmented images: number of objects detected, area and perimeter of all objects. On the basis of the parameters, a Transfer Function (TF) model was estimated with output variable defined as number of piglets in the pen. The developed model explained 82 % (R 2 ) variability in the training set composed of 5 sows and 81 % (R 2 ) in the validation set composed of 3 sows. Number of piglets in the pen was estimated with a standard error of 1.73 piglets in the training set and 1.72 in the validation set. The potential application of the developed technique is monitoring of start of farrowing, perinatal asphyxia and crushing in piglets. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Rumination and activity data were collected on 259 Holstein cows for 2.5 years on 2 French farms. The detection records were evaluated in comparison with HD detection by farm staff as the reference method. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for CUSUM settings, enabling a high specificity (97% and 90% for CUSUM on rumination time or on neck activity). The timing of detection was also evaluated. The most frequent HD were mastitis (n = 172), lameness (n = 129), impaired general condition without identified cause (n = 63) and diarrhoea (n=19). On average 40% of the HD detected by farm staff were detected by the CUSUM between 4 d before and 1 d after detection by farm staff, with sensitivities varying from 28% for mild lameness to 85% for severe mastitis. Sensitivities above 55% were obtained for impaired general condition episodes without identified cause, diarrhoea, and most of the rare but severe HD. The positive predictive values of CUSUM detections remained below 10% in our sample. Approximately 50% of the HD were detected at least 1 d before detection by farm staff, enabling early attention. Results suggest that, even if a large variety of HD were detected, the algorithms of this study would be useful for HD detection only in addition to visual appraisal. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Thus, AMS have been developed steadily regarding technical terms and the used software. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether an AMS of the newest generation with improved sensor technique and new algorithms had advantages in terms of efficiency and animal health compared to a previous model of the same manufacturer. Over a period of ten months, the data of 50 dairy cows were analysed. All cows were milked by a Lely Astronaut A2 as well as by a Lely Astronaut A4. As traits that could be influenced by the change of the milking system milkings per cow and day, milking intervals, time in AMS, milking time, milk yield and milk flow were investigated. All traits under consideration were tested for differences between AMS with generalized linear mixed models. The results of this investigations showed significant influences with the change to the new AMS regarding milking time, time in AMS, milk flow and milking intervals. Milking time and time in AMS decrease whereas milk yield, milk flow and milking interval increase in the new AMS. For milkings per cow and day no significant differences between both systems could be found. In conclusion, the purchase of an AMS of the newest generation could bring advantages regarding time for milking, milk flow and milking interval. However, changes in udder health and efficiency cannot be achieved with technical innovations, exclusively. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

This paper seeks to assess whether daily liveweight measures from an automatic milking system (AMS) can be used to indicate when the breeding period can start. Data from AMS and milk recording and advisory organisations (MRAO) were combined. The AMS could not be used directly and it was necessary to clean the data of load cell drift and to aggregate weights by ten-day lactation period in order to smooth daily variability. Finally we diversified our study database with other sources relating to animals. 1,195 Prim'Holstein lactations were used to link liveweight measurements and milk production in order to explain when the cows could be efficiently put to the bull or inseminated. Liveweight kinetics was not the only factor in our study, but an important one in determining the positive artificial insemination (AI) date. This data processing enables us to propose an indicator for dairy farmers to enable them to identify the best period to breed their cows, the BoB, or Beginning of Breeding. This indicator could make it possible, firstly to reduce the number of straws needed for the latest fertilisable cows, and, secondly, to reduce the interval between two calves for the earliest ones. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Consequently, accurate long-term monitoring of grooming behaviour could advantageously serve as a PLF solution to provide alarms or well-being indicators. The main activities of dairy cows (resting, moving, eating, etc.) can be monitored indoors 24/7 using a real-time location system (RTLS). During the EU-PLF project (2012-16), the CowView RTLS (GEA) was assessed on 160 cows, equipped with tags, in our freestall barn enhanced with mechanical swinging brushes (Delaval). From the large positioning dataset collected (1 location/animal/s), we extracted grooming behaviour (scratching using the brush) with good sensitivity (80%) and a suitable positive predictive value (60%). The accuracy of our grooming detection algorithm was evaluated by comparing the results obtained against video analyses. Subsequently, 23 dairy cows were monitored for 32 days, and patterns of grooming activity were analysed to study variations between cows and between days. 24-h video recording was re-visualised to explain the false detections observed, i.e. a cow detected in the brush area without grooming or a cow classified as grooming but not localised in the area. The kinetics of daily time spent grooming showed high day-to-day and inter-individual variations. Noisy tags appeared to be responsible for most of the false detections. Once smoothed, the kinetics modelled offer promising applications for detecting alterations in cow grooming behaviour patterns. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

The huge amount of data produced rapidly exhausts the battery in the device. To overcome this, an epoch, or size of aggregation window, can be set and applied to the data stream. We evaluated the effect of different epoch settings (5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 300 s) on the behaviour classification performance for cattle wearing a tri-axial accelerometer device (BEHARUM). A 5 day calibration trial was conducted with Sarda beef cattle equipped with the BEHARUM and allowed to range freely for 4 hrs in a 2 ha paddock of natural pasture. Acceleration data were acquired and recorded as a csv file in a receiving computer. At the same time, cattle behaviour was video-recorded by a fixed camera. Calibration and validation of the system for each epoch under study was performed by comparing acceleration data which was automatically classified into three activities, grazing, ruminating and resting (including other activities), with video-recorded data. A multivariate analysis procedure made it possible to correctly assign 77.6, 82.7, 89.1, 90.8, 92.4, 92.9, 93.4% of the 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180, 300 s epochs, respectively, to the three activities.

The expectation is that a robot also can execute such tasks and could do it 24 hours 7 days a week if needed. A concept of a multi-layer monitoring support system has been designed to assist the poultry farmer. The multi-layer support system consists of a static system for flock observation (existing PLF technology), and robot(s) for in-between bird observation of health and behaviour and for performing routine daily tasks. Poultry farmers, researchers and companies have been consulted in two workshops to identify the needs and wishes for such a system. The results of the consultations could be grouped into the following six main categories: 1) bird monitoring (e.g. behaviour, health); 2) data sharing (e.g. production, health); 3) eggs (e.g. selection, collection of floor eggs); 4) vaccination (e.g. treatment, evaluation); 5) quality control (e.g. manure consistency, litter); and 6) selection of birds (e.g. collecting dead birds, identifying non-productive birds). The overall results showed that there is a market demand of poultry farmers for such a multi-level monitoring system. A first economic survey showed that broiler farmers were willing to invest €0.58 per bird place with an desired payback time of 2 years and other poultry farmers were willing to invest €1.04 per bird place with a desired payback time of 4 years. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

This is especially important to record damaging behaviours, such as feather pecking in laying hens, or related traits. With traditional methods, such as live and video observations this is difficult and time consuming. Recent developments in sensor technology offer new possibilities for automatic tracking of behaviour of individuals. The aim of the PhenoLab project is to develop methods for automatic recording of location, activity and proximity in group-housed laying hens. Hundred thirty one laying hens from three feather pecking selection lines (high and low feather pecking (n = 45 and 41) and an unselected control line (n = 45)) were tracked using two different tracking systems: video-tracking using EthoVision and ultra-wideband tracking using TrackLab. Birds were tracked in three different situations: individually in a barren test-room (individual novel environment test), in a group in a barren test-room (group novel environment test) and in a group in a room offering four different functional areas (preference test). Preliminary results indicated that distance moved using TrackLab yielded up to 96% accuracy, when compared to video-tracking using EthoVision. For the group tests, ultra-wideband tracking seems the better option, as this method is better able to distinguish between individuals compared with video-tracking, as it relies on individual tags. Previously found line differences in activity, with the high feather pecking line showing higher activity levels than both other lines, were confirmed by the ultra-wideband tracking system. Furthermore, ultra-wideband tracking provides valuable information on the behaviour of specific individuals within a group, allowing us to investigate differences in activity patterns between feather peckers, victims and neutrals. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Since the advent of robotic and high throughput milking, the traditional few minutes available for individual human attention daily has disappeared and new automated technologies have been applied to improve monitoring of dairy cow production, nutrition, fertility, health and welfare. Cows milked by robots must meet legal requirements to detect healthy milk. This review focuses on emerging technical approaches in those areas of high cost to the farmer (fertility, metabolic disorders, mastitis, lameness and calving). The availability of low cost tri-axial accelerometers and wireless telemetry has allowed accurate models of behaviour to be developed and sometimes combined with rumination activity detected by acoustic sensors to detect oestrus; other measures (milk and skin temperature, electronic noses, milk yield) have been abandoned. In-line biosensors have been developed to detect markers for ovulation, pregnancy, lactose, mastitis and metabolic changes. Wireless telemetry has been applied to develop boluses for monitoring the rumen pH and temperature to detect metabolic disorders. Udder health requires a multisensing approach due to the varying inflammatory responses collectively described as mastitis. Lameness can be detected by walk over weigh cells, but also by various types of video image analysis and speed measurement.

While robots control the milking process, there have also been numerous changes to how the whole farm system is managed. Milking is no longer performed in defined sessions; rather, the cow can now choose when to be milked in AMS, allowing milking to be distributed throughout a 24 h period. Despite this ability, there has been little attention given to milking robot utilization across 24 h. In order to formulate relevant research questions and improve farm AMS management there is a need to determine the current knowledge gaps regarding the distribution of robot utilization. Feed, animal and management factors and their interplay on levels of milking robot utilization across 24 h for both indoor and pasture-based systems are here reviewed. The impact of the timing, type and quantity of feed offered and their interaction with the distance of feed from the parlour; herd social dynamics, climate and various other management factors on robot utilization through 24 h are provided.

In an enclosed waiting area, cows of different rank compete for entering the milking station and they are exposed for a variety of social interactions. Such interactions could increase standing time and delay milking, which may result in stress, lameness, impaired welfare and reduced performance. The aim was to monitor the waiting area in a free stall dairy by the use of three video cameras to detect occurrence of social interactions by using improved image segmentation and tracking methods. The surveillance system observed 252 cows having free access to any of four milking stations during 24 h over a period of two weeks. A two-step pattern recognition approach was used. In the first step geometric features (distances) were extracted from every pair of cows in every frame. These features form the input of the second step. It consists of a classifier of the behaviour of the cows. A support vector machine was used to realise this classifier. The social interactions were identified based on collision of geometrical shapes segmented from the image and positively identified as cows by experienced observers. The results showed that the proposed system was capable of a fairly accurate detection of social interactions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Computer vision; Dairy cattle; Object recognition; Precision Livestock Farming; Social interactions","Agriculture; Computer vision; Image segmentation; Object recognition; Pattern recognition; Social sciences; Video cameras; Dairy cattles; Feasibility studies; Geometrical shapes; Precision livestock farming; Segmentation and tracking; Social interactions; Surveillance systems; Video surveillance systems; Security systems; automation; cattle; computer simulation; dairy farming; feasibility study; image analysis; milk production; monitoring system; pattern recognition; precision agriculture; segmentation; support vector machine; tracking; videography; Bos"

The aim of this study was to develop a feed intake model for the individual dairy cow that includes feeding behavior. In a research farm, the individual cows' voluntary feed intake and feeding behavior were monitored at every meal. A feed intake model was developed based on data that exist in commercial modern farms: 'BW,' 'milk yield' and 'days in milking' parameters were applied in this study. At the individual cow level, eating velocity seemed to be correlated with feed intake (R 2=0.93 to 0.94). The eating velocity coefficient varied among individuals, ranging from 150 to 230 g/min per cow. The contribution of feeding behavior (0.28) to the dry matter intake (DMI) model was higher than the contribution of BW (0.20), similar to the contribution of fat-corrected milk (FCM)/BW (0.29) and not as large as the contribution of FCM (0.49). Incorporating feeding behavior into the DMI model improved its accuracy by 1.3 (38%) kg/cow per day.

Separating sick cows from the herd is important, especially in robotic-milking dairy farms, where searching for a sick cow can disturb the other cows' routine. The objectives of this study were to develop and apply a behaviour- and performance-based health-detection model to post-calving cows in a robotic-milking dairy farm, with the aim of detecting sick cows based on available commercial sensors. The study was conducted in an Israeli robotic-milking dairy farm with 250 Israeli-Holstein cows. All cows were equipped with rumination- and neck-activity sensors. Milk yield, visits to the milking robot and BW were recorded in the milking robot. A decision-tree model was developed on a calibration data set (historical data of the 10 months before the study) and was validated on the new data set. The decision model generated a probability of being sick for each cow. The model was applied once a week just before the veterinarian performed the weekly routine post-calving health check. The veterinarian's diagnosis served as a binary reference for the model (healthy-sick). The overall accuracy of the model was 78%, with a specificity of 87% and a sensitivity of 69%, suggesting its practical value. © The Animal Consortium 2016.","Automatic milking system; Behaviour sensor; Health; Individual dairy cows; Precision livestock farming","animal; animal experiment; animal food; birth; body weight; bovine; Cattle Diseases; decision tree; digestion; milk; physiology; robotics; secretion (process); theoretical model; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Body Weight; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Decision Trees; Digestion; Milk; Models, Theoretical; Parturition; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Robotics"

Today, BCS is performed manually by experts. This paper presents a 3-dimensional algorithm that provides a topographical understanding of the cow's body to estimate BCS. An automatic BCS system consisting of a Kinect camera (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) triggered by a passive infrared motion detector was designed and implemented. Image processing and regression algorithms were developed and included the following steps: (1) image restoration, the removal of noise; (2) object recognition and separation, identification and separation of the cows; (3) movie and image selection, selection of movies and frames that include the relevant data; (4) image rotation, alignment of the cow parallel to the x-axis; and (5) image cropping and normalization, removal of irrelevant data, setting the image size to 150 × 200 pixels, and normalizing image values. All steps were performed automatically, including image selection and classification. Fourteen individual features per cow, derived from the cows’ topography, were automatically extracted from the movies and from the farm's herd-management records. These features appear to be measurable in a commercial farm. Manual BCS was performed by a trained expert and compared with the output of the training set. A regression model was developed, correlating the features with the manual BCS references. Data were acquired for 4 d, resulting in a database of 422 movies of 101 cows. Movies containing cows’ back ends were automatically selected (389 movies). The data were divided into a training set of 81 cows and a test set of 20 cows; both sets included the identical full range of BCS classes. Accuracy tests gave a mean absolute error of 0.26, median absolute error of 0.19, and coefficient of determination of 0.75, with 100% correct classification within 1 step and 91% correct classification within a half step for BCS classes. Results indicated good repeatability, with all standard deviations under 0.33. The algorithm is independent of the background and requires 10 cows for training with approximately 30 movies of 4 s each. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association","body condition scoring; cattle; computer vision; precision livestock farming; sensor","algorithm; animal; automation; bovine; dairying; devices; female; physiology; procedures; three dimensional imaging; veterinary; Algorithms; Animals; Automation; Cattle; Dairying; Female; Imaging, Three-Dimensional"

In this context, animal geolocation systems applied to extensive farming are interesting for farmers to optimize their daily work organization. Nevertheless, the deployment of these solutions implies several technical challenges which must be resolved, mainly the energy consumption and the suitability of the communication protocols. A recently developed solution that deals with these technical challenges is the e-Pasto platform, which is composed of low power geolocation devices embedded into collars that offer an energetic autonomy of at least seven months, completed with a visualization user interface. The autonomy is assured employing a duty-cycle operation that results in one geolocation position measurement per hour. This work studies the employ of accelerometers to overcome this limitation assuring, at the same time, the required autonomy for the geolocation device. The authors also propose an algorithm that processes the acceleration data in order to identify the steps of an individual.

Twelve static tags, in a four by three grid, transmitted for 28 days. The 12 tags recorded 36,452 transmissions with a mean transmission per tag of 3037. Each transmission included the tag number, date and time and the calculated longitude and latitude. The mean location and then the Euclidean distance from the mean location for each tag were calculated in order to derive location precision per tag. The overall precision for the 12 tags was ±22 m with a SD of 49 m with the most and least precise tags having precisions of ±8 m and ±51 m, respectively. As with other geolocation technologies, it would appear that structures in the environment cause signal propagation effects including multipath and non-line-of-sight, which result in errors in the derived locations.The distance from the mean data was log transformed (log10) and summarised in order to present all data over a 24-h period. There was a statistically significant decrease in precision between 11:00 and 17:00 h. These data were correlated with meteorological parameters for the period of the trial, again summarised over 24 h, with temperature, humidity, wind speed and pressure all having significant correlations with the precision data.The variance between individual tag transmissions were compared to see whether the distance between derived locations increased as time between transmissions increased. The means for each tag showed the same variance as the mean precision values, that is the more precise tags had lower means and the less precise tags had higher means. However, no tags showed a trend towards an increase in the distance between locations as the time between transmissions increased.In order to assess whether there was any spatial variability in the derived locations, the variability in distance between tags was compared for all tag combinations. Tags that were proximal to each other had shorter distances between the mean derived locations and less variance, whereas tags farther apart had large distances and large variance in the mean derived locations.The ARATS assessed in this static evaluation showed a lower level of spatial precision than commercially available global positioning systems. However the system could still have application when used to derive proximal associations between animals in low stocking-rate, extensive grazing situations such as are present in northern Australia. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..","Livestock; Precision; Radiolocation; Spatial; Taggle; Temporal","Agriculture; Animals; Radio navigation; Tracking (position); Wind; Livestock; Precision; Radiolocation; Spatial; Taggle; Temporal; Location; automation; biotelemetry; environmental factor; grazing; humidity; livestock farming; precision; spatial resolution; tagging; temperature effect; temporal analysis; tracking; Australia; Animalia"

Thus, perceiving animal information and behaviors are fundamental to precision livestock farming. A research review of respiration detection, locomotion score, body condition score, individual identification, behavioral analysis, etc. were summarized focusing on large animals, including cows, pigs, sheep, which are prevalent instock farming industry. And a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of different methods applied in all the aspects was presented in this review. In term of individual information acquisition and analysis(e.g., individual identification and body condition score), solutions based on 3D camera and depth image processing technolygy were emphasized, because such cameras were more robust to the environment when extracting the animal target from the image. In addition, locomotion score was one of the most important topics in precision livestock farming. Electronic sensors, audio recorder and digital cameras were used to perceive the individual information and prove feasible to detect the animals' lameness automatically. Because of the earlier lameness detection requirements of practical application, the pathology of the limbs and hooves disease, the automatic trauma detection and universal parameters of lameness without scoring system should be considered in the future. In the behavior analysis aspect, some new research approaches were emphasized including the limb segmentation algorithm and the combination with human behavior analysis theory and method. Considering the development trend and requirements of practical application in precision farming, animals' social behavior should be considered.

Small, portable data loggers have been validated as an inexpensive and effective alternative to video or live observation for automated activity detection in several livestock species. Our study aimed to validate the use of Onset HOBO Pendant® G acceleration data loggers for automated step detection in two age classes of male turkeys: growers and finishers. The loggers were attached to one leg in an elastic harness and programmed to record each turkey's leg accelerations every 0.1 s. For the grower turkeys, the activities of 60 males were recorded in a runway twice per week from 9-11 weeks of age. In the finisher trial, the loggers were attached to eight 14 week old male turkeys to record their stepping activities in a trial pen over 54 min. Simultaneous video observation allowed for logger suitability to be determined for reporting walking activity. The 0.1 s data points were identified as either: true positives, false positives, false negatives, or true negatives then the logger sensitivity, false discovery rate, specificity, precision, and accuracy were calculated for each turkey run. Over the 309 grower turkey runs, 4364 steps were observed in the video while the loggers detected 4865 steps. The grower logger results showed a mean sensitivity of 96.02 ± 6.82%, specificity of 99.10 ± 0.86%, and an average false discovery rate of 12.41 ± 10.13% for step detection (mean ± standard deviation). For the grower turkey loggers, the mean precision and accuracy for step detection were 87.59 ± 10.13% and 98.95 ± 0.77%. For the eight finisher turkeys, a total of 2420 steps were seen by the video and the loggers recorded 2691 data points as steps.

The experiment took place in the research farm of University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, using a herd of 120 Edelschwein sows. Data were collected from 9 sows housed in farrowing pens. The behaviour of 9 sows was video recorded and labelled for a period of 24 h before farrowing, with focus on nest-building activities. Each sow had a specific ear tag with an 3 axis accelerometer sensor mounted on the ear. Acceleration was measured at a frequency of 10 Hz. Out of nine sows under observation, six were assigned to the training set and three as a test set. Classification of nest-building events in the test set using accelerometer data with the generalised linear model indicated sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 85% and accuracy of 86%. The developed technique can be used as part of a Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) automatic monitoring system, where PLF can be defined as management of livestock production using the principles and technology of process engineering. On-farm application of the system would give the possibility to keep sows unconfined until the end of nest-building period. Thus, crating of individual sows could be limited to the first few days after farrowing when the risk of piglet crushing is high. This would improve welfare of sows, without an increase in piglet mortality and without extra labour demand for observation. © 2015 IAgrE.","Accelerometer; Automated monitoring; Farrowing; Nest-building behaviour; Sow","Accelerometers; Agriculture; Buildings; Precision engineering; Structural analysis; Veterinary medicine; Automated monitoring; Automatic monitoring-system; Farrowing; Generalised linear models; Livestock production; Nest-building behaviour; Precision livestock farming; Sow; Classification (of information)"

This paper proposes a novel method to automatically measure the growth rate of broiler chickens by sound analysis.Through the application of process engineering, Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) can combine audio and video information into on-line automated tools that can be used to control, monitor and model the behaviour, health and production of animals and their biological response.The aim of this study was to record and analyse broiler vocalisations under normal farm conditions, to identify the relation between animal sounds and their weight. Recordings were made at regular intervals, during the entire life of birds, in order to evaluate the variation of frequency and bandwidth of the sounds emitted by the animals.Two experimental trials were carried out in an indoor reared broiler farm; the audio recording procedures lasted for 38. days. The recordings were made, in an automated, non-invasive and non-intrusive way and without disturbing the animals in to the broiler house. Once a week, 50 birds were selected at random and their weight recorded in order to follow the growth trend in the birds.Sound recordings were manually analysed and labelled using the Adobe® Audition™ CS6 software.Analysing the sounds recorded, it was possible to find a significant correlation (. P<. 0.001) between the frequencies of the vocalisations recorded and the weight of the broilers.The results explained how the frequency of the sounds emitted by the animals was inversely proportional to the age and to the weight of the broilers; the more they grow, the lower the frequency of the sounds emitted by the animals.This preliminary study, conducted in an indoor reared broiler farm, shows how this method based on the identification of specific frequencies of the sounds, linked to the age and to the weight of the birds, might be used as an early warning method/system to evaluate the health and welfare status of the animals at farm level.

In Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), technology continuously measures various variables as activity, food intake or oestrus activity, thereby supporting farmers in monitoring his livestock. Sound analysis has shown to be useful as an early warning tool in pigs and it is unknown whether sound analysis can also be applied in cattle. Goal of this research was to determine whether a correlation can be found between cattle vocalisation and cattle behaviour.The vocalisations and behaviour of Holstein Friesian cattle were observed using audio and video recordings. Four cameras and four microphones were installed at a high production dairy farm in Herwijnen, the Netherlands. Three sets (a set consisting of both a camera and a microphone) recorded dairy cattle between two and fourteen years of age, one set recorded heifers between four and ten months of age. Recordings were made for fifteen days in three consecutive weeks, ten hours per day.Calls of cattle were traced to an individual cow and, if possible, linked with simultaneously expressed behaviour. The used ethogram consisted of six behavioural groups: lying & ruminating, feeding related behaviour, social interaction, sexual related behaviour, stress related behaviour and remaining behaviour. Lying & ruminating was a separate class since this behaviour expresses the needs of a cow. The maximum frequency in Hertz (Hz) of each call was determined. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference between the mean maximum frequency (Hz) of calls during lying & ruminating and calls recorded during other behaviours (83. ±. 4.3. Hz versus 298. ±. 8.0. Hz; p<. 0.05). Calls by adult dairy cattle had a significantly lower maximum frequency (Hz) than calls by heifers. (332.6. ±. 0.2. Hz versus 218.5. Hz. ±. 0.3.

Automated behavioural classification has the potential to improve health and welfare monitoring processes as part of a Precision Livestock Farming approach. Recent studies have used accelerometers and pedometers to classify behavioural activities in dairy cows, but such approaches often cannot discriminate accurately between biologically important behaviours such as feeding, lying and standing or transition events between lying and standing. In this study we develop a decision-tree algorithm that uses tri-axial accelerometer data from a neck-mounted sensor to both classify biologically important behaviour in dairy cows and to detect transition events between lying and standing. Results: Data were collected from six dairy cows that were monitored continuously for 36 h. Direct visual observations of each cow were used to validate the algorithm. Results show that the decision-tree algorithm is able to accurately classify three types of biologically relevant behaviours: lying (77.42 % sensitivity, 98.63 % precision), standing (88.00 % sensitivity, 55.00 % precision), and feeding (98.78 % sensitivity, 93.10 % precision). Transitions between standing and lying were also detected accurately with an average sensitivity of 96.45 % and an average precision of 87.50 %. The sensitivity and precision of the decision-tree algorithm matches the performance of more computationally intensive algorithms such as hidden Markov models and support vector machines. Conclusions: Biologically important behavioural activities in housed dairy cows can be classified accurately using a simple decision-tree algorithm applied to data collected from a neck-mounted tri-axial accelerometer. The algorithm could form part of a real-time behavioural monitoring system in order to automatically detect dairy cow health and welfare status. © 2015 Vázquez Diosdado et al.","Behavioural classification; Decision-tree algorithm; Precision livestock farming; Reality mining; Tri-axial accelerometer",

In literature the suitability of using behavioural changes to provide an early indication of disease is studied. The possibility of achieving a real-time analysis of a number of specific changes in behaviours, such as lying, feeding, and standing, is crucial for disease prevention.Cow feeding and standing behaviour detectors were modelled and validated by defining a methodology based on the Viola-Jones algorithm and using a multi-camera video-recording system to obtain panoramic top-view images of an area of the barn.Assessment of the detection results was carried out by comparison with the results generated by visual recognition. The ability of the system to detect cow behaviours was shown by the high values of its sensitivity achieved for the behaviours of feeding and standing which were about 87% and 86%, respectively. Branching factor values for the two behaviours showed that one false positive was detected for every 13 and 6 well-detected cows, respectively. On the basis of these research outcomes, the proposed system is suitable for computing cow behavioural indices and the real-time detection of behavioural changes. © 2015 IAgrE.","Cow behavioural activity; Dairy farming; Precision livestock farming; Vision techniques","Agriculture; Computer vision; Video recording; Automatic Detection; Behavioural changes; Dairy farming; Precision livestock farming; Real-time detection; Viola - Jones algorithms; Vision based system; Vision technique; Feeding"

The aim of the present study was to design and develop a software platform for the Management of Livestock Farm, which will lead to profitable farm management and resource savings. The software is developed within the cloud architecture of 'GAIA Epiheirein', which is specifically optimized for agrifood services. Thirty small ruminants' farmers were interviewed and every need and activity of the farm was recorded in detail. Following that procedure, the smart management application was designed and implemented accordingly. The application is monitoring the current status of the farm providing information for each animal (ear tag number, genealogical data, health status, and growth rate), production stage, reproduction information, stocking density, farm population, ration data, supplier information. Daily, monthly and annual reports on feed intake, feed conversion ratio, milk production and analysis, production cost, statistical data and correlations between similar farms and automatic alerts on supply needs, upcoming diseases, reproduction and notification on daily tasks on farm are being created. Transferring all the farm related information to the cloud enables inter-farm statistical reporting and business intelligence services provision, therefore enabling the optimization of farm management.","Cloud computing; Farm management; Information technologies; Livestock; Precision farming","Agriculture; Animals; Cloud computing; Environmental impact; Information technology; Mammals; Population statistics; Farm management; Feed conversion ratios; Livestock; Livestock production; Management applications; Precision farming; Precision livestock farming; Statistical reporting; Farms"

It is argued that the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and PLF approaches could be complementary in the effort to improve the quality of environmental impact assessment results.","Dairy cattle production; Greece; LCA; LCI","Agriculture; Dairies; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Nitrogen oxides; Soil pollution; Dairy cattles; Greece; LCA; LCI; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle inventories; Life cycle inventory analysis; Precision livestock farming; Life cycle"

Among the important factors in achieving improved efficiency is the provision of an optimal building environment with low Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) emissions. The present paper summarises the main results of a national (Greek) project running under the auspices of the General Secretariat for Research and Technology. The GreenPoultry project tackles a subject of great economical and social importance for the Greek regions, especially for those where livestock operations are very intense (e.g. Epirus). Poultry breeding constitutes the most dynamic sector of Greek stock-raising representing 5% of the agricultural economy and 10% of the animal sector, while the number of raised birds has increased 75% during the last three decades. In parallel, poultry farms are considered as major rural pollutants and energy consumers. The main goal of the GreenPoultry project was to reduce the environmental footprint of poultry facilities through a sustainable reduction of released air pollutants and GHGs along with a decrease in energy consumption. This was achieved among others through the use of precision livestock farming (PLF) techniques. A set of wireless sensors for measuring environmental and climate parameters was installed in commercial poultry farms. Project's results include best design techniques concerning the poultry facility construction (i.e. building geometry and construction materials, ventilation techniques, dimensionalizing, positioning and operation strategy of E/M systems, etc.) that can lead to favorable indoor microclimate and energy reduction.","Computational fluid dynamics; Energy audits; Environmental footprint; Greece; Poultry production; Wireless network","Building materials; Computational fluid dynamics; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Pollution; Wireless networks; Wireless sensor networks; Agricultural economy; Energy audit; Environmental footprints; Environmental-friendly; Greece; Livestock operations; Poultry production; Precision livestock farming; Agriculture"

In large herds it is difficult for stockmen to monitor all cows closely. If changes in the milking order are indicative of health or other problems, the monitoring of any changes in the order could alert stockmen to such problems. This could therefore be a tool to add to the parameters collected routinely in precision livestock farming (PLF). The milking process of 692 cows, in seven different feeding groups, over a period of six months, was monitored. The milking order was found to be stable within days, and across days, but was more variable within milking sessions. Cows with mastitis (P<. 0.001) entered the parlour later than when they were healthy. Cows with metritis entered into the milking parlour earlier than usually (. P<. 0.05). When new cows entered a group they fitted into a stable position within the parlour entrance order within two days. There were no effects found of parity, age, days in milk, milk production or milking duration on the milking order. It is concluded that the regular monitoring of milking order, and flagging of changes in this order could be a useful tool in the early identification of the presence of disease in cows. © 2015.","Dairy cows' behaviour; Health monitoring; Mastitis; Milking order; Precision livestock farming (PLF)","behavioral response; cattle; dairy farming; disease incidence; feeding; health monitoring; identification method; milk"

Accelerometers (Hobo Pendant G) were put in a metal case and fastened onto the leg of 6 group-housed sows with two cable ties. The data loggers recorded the acceleration on one axis every 20 s. Data were then validated by 9 hours of direct observations. Accelerometers were then attached to 12 to 13 group-housed sows for 2 to 4 consecutive days on 6 commercial farms equipped with electronic sow feeding. On average, sows spent 259 minutes (± 114) standing and changed posture 29 (± 12) times each day. The sow's standing time was repeatable day to day. Differences between sows and herds were significant. Five categories of sows were identified on the basis of behavioural data. This study suggests that studying the individual behaviour of each animal would improve herd management.","Accelerometer; Activity; Automatic recording; Group housed sows","Accelerometers; Animals; Thermodynamic properties; Automatic monitoring; Automatic recording; Direct observations; Group-housed sows; Individual behaviour; Method development; Physical activity; Precision livestock farming; Agriculture"

With that thought in mind, Smart Dairy Farming (SDF) developed a platform to make real-time sensor data from different farms available, for model developers to support dairy farmers in Precision Livestock Farming. The data has been made available via a standard interface on an open platform in real-time at the individual animal level. The platform, known as InfoBroker, must furthermore be suitable for a large-scale roll-out. The concept of this InfoBroker is designed as a breakthrough when it comes to making data stored in diverse places available in an efficient manner. Data is not stored centrally, but remains at the source. The InfoBroker is capable of retrieving individual cow data from an infinite number of sources while at the same time serving a large number of models on-demand. For each farm it is specified which data may be released by the InfoBroker. This means that the farmer continues to be the owner of the data.

Appropriate concentrate supplementary feeding during pregnancy is known to improve the success of pregnancy, resulting in live healthy lambs. However, feeding and associated labour present large costs to the farm business. Supplementary feeding should be provided with the most efficient method possible, maximising benefits whilst controlling costs. This paper explores the feasibility and impact on ewe performance of two different methods of feed allocation, trialled on a hill flock in the West Highlands of Scotland. A conventional (CON) method, where current body condition was considered in allocating supplementary feeding levels, was run alongside a Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) approach where proportion of body weight change was utilised. The latter approach was facilitated by an automatic drafting weigh crate with electronic identification (EID) reader, thereby allowing individual ewe EID ear tags to be read and sheep sorted automatically. At two points during winter pregnancy, ewes were handled and allocated to either standard or corrective feed supplementation by either CON or PLF methods. This study demonstrated that the method used to segregate a large flock into groups based on weight change using EID and automated weighing is both feasible and straightforward. Despite more CON ewes going into corrective feeding groups (33% of PLF and 44% of CON), the PLF approach was more successful in moving ewes out of corrective into standard feeding groups by the end of mid pregnancy (52% of the PLF ewes successfully moved from corrective to standard feeding, compared to only 25% of the ewes in CON).","Automatic drafting; Automatic weighing; Electronic identification; Extensive sheep; Feeding; Pregnancy","Computer graphics; Feeding; Obstetrics; Weighing; Animal productivity; Automatic drafting; Body condition; Controlling costs; Economic viability; Extensive sheep; Precision livestock farming; Pregnancy; Agriculture"

For reasons of public concern and due to the large number of animals involved, it is considered by many people to be important to take care of the welfare and health status of the chickens reared under intensive farm conditions. Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) can support the farmer in his day to day routine management through the use of sensors, cameras and microphones, and these have the potential to improve production and to enable monitoring of welfare status. In this context, the 7FP EU-PLF project aims to test the efficiency of the use of those sensors at farm level. In particular, the aim of this study was to record and analyse broiler vocalisations under normal farm conditions and to identify the relation between animal sounds, and growth trends. Recordings were made at regular intervals, for the entire short production life of the birds, in order to evaluate the variation of frequency and bandwidth of the sounds emitted by the animals during the cycle of production. The recordings were made in an automated, non-invasive and non-intrusive way and the sound data was compared with the weight of the birds automatically measured by a 'step on scale' placed on the floor of the broiler house. Sound analysis was performed based on the amplitude and frequency of the sound signal in audio files recorded at farm level. Through analysis of the sounds recorded, a significant correlation (P<0.001) between the frequencies of the vocalisations recorded and the weight of the broilers was found across all production cycles and farms assessed. The ongoing goal will be the development of a tool able to automatically detect the growth of the animals based on the frequency of the vocalisation emitted by the birds at different ages, and as a possible tool for determining deviations from their expected growth trend.","Broiler; Frequency analysis; Growth trend; Precision livestock farming; Vocalisation; Welfare","Animals; Audio acoustics; Birds; Scales (weighing instruments); Broiler; Frequency Analysis; Growth trends; Precision livestock farming; Vocalisation; Welfare; Agriculture"

Monitoring methods based on image and sound analysis are attractive to farmers and other stakeholders as they have potential to improve animal welfare, increase technical results and minimise the carbon footprint. However, most farmers and other stakeholders (e.g. vets) do not currently have the skills and time to utilise these technologies effectively. It is time-consuming to combine and analyse the data resulting from different sensors in different formats and frequencies. As part of the EU-PLF project, the authors developed a visualisation tool to bring together scattered data, analyse the data and present them to the end user in an easy-to-use format. The aim of the EU-PLF project is to create added value for the farmer, improve animal welfare, and reduce emissions through the application of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) techniques such as sensors and information technology. Data were collected at five broiler farms and ten pig farms across Europe. At the farms, a number of variables were automatically measured including climate data (temperature, relative humidity and ventilation rate), production data (feed supply, water consumption and animal weight), environmental data (dust and ammonia), and data coming from cameras and microphones. Simultaneously, animal welfare was assessed regularly by trained assessors (three times per flock for poultry and every month for pigs). All the data were gathered, stored and processed on a daily basis, and visualised on a website. Emphasis was placed on reducing the time between data acquisition and delivery of value-added products to farmers, and providing training so that the end users could understand how to interpret the information. The invited farmers actively participated in evaluating the usefulness of the information, resulting in a web-based visualisation tool that is practical and useful for both farmers and other stakeholders (e.g. vets, advisors, research).","Broilers; Data visualization; Farmer; Pigs; Precision livestock farming; Training","Animals; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Data acquisition; Data visualization; Emission control; Mammals; Personnel training; Visualization; Websites; Broilers; Environmental data; Farmer; Monitoring methods; Pigs; Precise monitoring; Precision livestock farming; Value added products; Agriculture"

Since this method could suffer from limitations widely discussed in literature, the research activity described in this paper aimed at developing a computer-vision based system (CVBS) for the automatic detection of dairy cow behaviours within digital images. The system was composed of a multi-camera video-recording system and a software component which included four cow behaviour detectors (i.e., cow lying, cow standing, cow feeding, and cow perching detectors) modelled by using the Viola-Jones's algorithm. The number of true positives (TP), false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP) produced by the CVBS was obtained from a validation phase which involved the work of an operator who checked the CVBS detection results. Next, the field performances of the CVBS were evaluated by using the following accuracy indices: sensitivity index, i.e., the ratio between TP and the number of cows really existing in the monitored area; branching factor (BF), i.e., the ratio between FP and TP; miss factor (MF), i.e., the ratio between FN and TP. The highest value of the sensitivity index was recorded for the lying behaviour detector (0.92), whereas the lowest one (0.86) for the standing behaviour detector. The minimum value of BF and MF were obtained for the cow lying behaviour detector (0.08 and 0.09, respectively), whereas the maximum values were recorded for the standing behaviour detector (0.17 for both).","Cow behavioural activity; Dairy farming; Precision livestock farming","Computer vision; Image processing; Video recording; Automatic Detection; Breeding environments; Dairy farming; Multi-camera video; Precision livestock farming; Research activities; Sensitivity indices; Vision based system; Agriculture"

It interacts with reproductive and health performance, which are important to consider in dairy production but not easy to monitor. The commonly used body condition score (BCS) is time consuming, subjective, and not very sensitive. The aim was therefore to develop and validate a method assessing BCS with 3-dimensional (3D) surfaces of the cow's rear. A camera captured 3D shapes 2 m from the floor in a weigh station at the milking parlor exit. The BCS was scored by 3 experts on the same day as 3D imaging. Four anatomical landmarks had to be identified manually on each 3D surface to define a space centered on the cow's rear. A set of 57 3D surfaces from 56 Holstein dairy cows was selected to cover a large BCS range (from 0.5 to 4.75 on a 0 to 5 scale) to calibrate 3D surfaces on BCS. After performing a principal component analysis on this data set, multiple linear regression was fitted on the coordinates of these surfaces in the principal components' space to assess BCS. The validation was performed on 2 external data sets: one with cows used for calibration, but at a different lactation stage, and one with cows not used for calibration. Additionally, 6 cows were scanned once and their surfaces processed 8 times each for repeatability and then these cows were scanned 8 times each the same day for reproducibility. The selected model showed perfect calibration and a good but weaker validation (root mean square error = 0.31 for the data set with cows used for calibration; 0.32 for the data set with cows not used for calibration). Assessing BCS with 3D surfaces was 3 times more repeatable (standard error = 0.075 versus 0.210 for BCS) and 2.8 times more reproducible than manually scored BCS (standard error = 0.103 versus 0.280 for BCS). The prediction error was similar for both validation data sets, indicating that the method is not less efficient for cows not used for calibration. The major part of reproducibility error incorporates repeatability error. An automation of the anatomical landmarks identification is required, first to allow broadband measures of body condition and second to improve repeatability and consequently reproducibility. Assessing BCS using 3D imaging coupled with principal component analysis appears to be a very promising means of improving precision and feasibility of this trait measurement. © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.","3-dimensional imaging; Body condition score; Precision livestock farming; Principal component analysis","anatomy and histology; animal; body composition; bovine; dairying; energy metabolism; female; health status; lactation; milk; physiology; principal component analysis; procedures; reproducibility; reproduction; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; veterinary; Animals; Body Composition; Cattle; Dairying; Energy Metabolism; Female; Health Status; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Lactation; Linear Models; Milk; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Reproduction"

The productivity in the sector is six times below its potential at current factors costs. Poor yield (output per dairy animal) explains the gap between current and potential productivity. The yield is low due to inadequate dairy management, poor animal husbandry and poor quality animals. So, there is need of suitable and proper managemental techniques which can improve the efficiency of production. Precision livestock farming can become a tool in this context.

The first question is how to achieve high-quality, sustainable and safe meat production that can meet this demand. At the same time, livestock production is currently facing serious problems. Concerns about animal health in relation to food safety and human health are increasing. The European Union wants improved animal welfare and has made a significant investment in it. At the same time, the environmental impact of the livestock sector is a major issue. Finally, it is necessary to ask how the farmer, who is the central figure in this process, will make a living from more sustainable livestock production systems. One tool that might provide real opportunities is precision livestock farming (PLF). In contrast to previous approaches, PLF systems aim to offer a real-time monitoring and management system that focuses on improving the life of the animals by warning when problems arise so that the farmer may take immediate action. Continuous, fully automatic monitoring and improvement of animal health and welfare, product yields and environmental impacts should become possible. This paper presents examples of systems that have already been developed in order to demonstrate the potential benefits of this technology.","Animal health; Animal welfare; Image analysis; Precision livestock farming; Realtime monitoring; Sound analysis","animal; animal behavior; animal housing; animal husbandry; animal welfare; article; biological model; livestock; methodology; standard; videorecording; Animal Husbandry; Animal Welfare; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Housing, Animal; Livestock; Models, Biological; Video Recording"

Precision livestock farming technologies bring the possibility of closely monitoring the behaviour, liveweight and other parameters of individual animals in free-ranging systems. 'Virtual fencing', ideally based on positive reinforcement, i.e. rewarding animals for moving in a specified direction, has the potential to gently guide foraging livestock towards areas of vegetation identified by remote sensing. As well as reducing hunger, this could be integrated with weather forecasting to help ensure that animals are automatically directed to areas with appropriate shelter when adverse weather is forecast. The system could also direct animals towards handling facilities when required, reducing the fear and distress associated with being mustered. The integration of the various data collected by such a 'virtual shepherd' system should be able to rapidly detect disease and injury, and sick animals could then be automatically shepherded to an enclosure for treatment. In general, rangeland livestock already have the freedom to express normal behaviour, but PLF technologies could facilitate this. By bringing levels of monitoring and control normally associated with intensive production to rangeland systems, PLF has the potential, with appropriate adoption, to enhance the capacity of rangeland livestock production systems to meet key areas of welfare concern highlighted by the Five Freedoms.","Cattle; Goats; Precision livestock farming; Rangeland; Sheep; Virtual fence; Virtual shepherd; Welfare","animal; animal behavior; animal husbandry; animal welfare; article; bovids; livestock; methodology; physiology; standard; veterinary medicine; Animal Husbandry; Animal Welfare; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Livestock; Ruminants; Veterinary Medicine"

From these video recordings, a dataset containing 150 episodes with and 150 episodes without aggressive interactions was built through manual labelling. The Motion History Image was used to gain information about the pigs' motion and to relate this information to aggressive interactions. Two features were extracted from the segmented region of the Motion History Image: the mean intensity of motion and the occupation index. Based on these two features, the Linear Discriminant Analysis was used to classify aggressive interactions in every episode. Applying leave-one-out cross-validation, the accuracy of the system was 89.0% with a sensitivity of 88.7% and a specificity of 89.3%.

Reliable calving time prediction is fundamental to enable the operator to act quickly and reduce potential injury to the calf directly caused by the mother or by environmental factors. The prediction is of particular importance for pregnant cows in extensive grazing areas where, because of the territorial extension, it is difficult to quickly intervene when needed. In order to solve these problems, a new GPS-Calving Alarm (GPS-CAL) was designed, manufactured and tested to analyze its technical and economic performance. The device accurately identifies the time when delivery begins and advises the farmer via SMS. The SMS includes birth event date and hour, animal ID and geographical coordinates of the partum point. The position is measured through a GPS receiver embedded in the device. By importing the GPS coordinates into a common application for mobile phones and following the visual instructions, it is possible to reach the animals at pasture. In order to evaluate device performance, both laboratory and field tests were carried out. Laboratory tests showed GPS adopted receiver accuracy (1.2. m) and an adequate battery life (over 1. month) for monitoring calving events in grazing areas. Field tests, carried out in intensive and extensive breeding conditions, confirmed that the GPS-CAL system worked well, and was highly reliable (sensitivity of 100%, positive predictive value PPV of 100%). Finally, the economic aspects relative to the adoption of the GPS-CAL system were analyzed. The possibility to monitor 10. calvings/year by each device, at a unitary cost of €31,5/birth, sustainable by the farmer were taken into consideration. The originality and effectiveness of the GPS-CAL system, as confirmed by workers in the sector, allowed the authors, the Università degli Studi di Milano and the Sisteck (Sassuolo, Italy) to patent the system in Italy and Europe. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Animal monitoring; Birth alarm; GNSS collar; Precision livestock","Agriculture; Alarm systems; Animals; Birth alarm; Device performance; Economic performance; Environmental factors; Geographical coordinates; GNSS collar; Positive predictive values; Precision livestock; Global positioning system; agricultural technology; cost-benefit analysis; environmental factor; GPS; grazing; livestock farming; precision agriculture; prediction; pregnancy; Europe; Italy; Animalia; Mammalia"

Initially, simple equations were used to describe the growth of animals or their parts and to predict nutrient requirements for different livestock species. The advent of computers led to development of complex multi-equation, dynamic models of animal metabolism and of the interaction between animals and their environment. An understanding was developed about how animal systems could be integrated in models to obtain the most realistic prediction of observations and allow accurate predictions of as yet unobserved events. Animal models have been used to illustrate how well animal systems are understood and to identify areas requiring further research. Many animal models have been developed with the aim of evaluating alternative management strategies within animal enterprises. Several important gaps in current animal models requiring further development are identified: including a more mechanistic representation of the control of feed intake; inclusion of methyl-donor requirements and simulation of the methionine cycle; plus a more mechanistic representation of disease and the impact of microbial loads under production environments. Reasons are identified why few animal models have been used for day-to-day decision making on farm. In the future, animal simulation models are envisaged to function as real-time control of systems within animal enterprises to optimise animal productivity, carcass quality, health, welfare and to maximise profit. Further development will be required for the integration of models that run real time in enterprise management systems adopting precision livestock farming technologies. © CSIRO 2014.","adoption; decision making; farming systems; feed intake; immune response; metabolism; methyl-donor metabolism; monogastrics; ruminants; simulation modelling.","Animalia"

Evidence indicates that if the time of farrowing can be predicted, the mortality can be reduced through planned supervision or improved climate regulation. The aim of the study was to improve the prediction of onset of farrowing by monitoring pre-parturient behaviour of sows using several sensors and by developing an automated system for the prediction of time to farrowing. The resulting prediction model, named as Hidden Phase-type Markov Model (HPMM), assumes that a sow passes through the behavioural states Before Nest-Building, Nest-Building and Resting before reaching the Farrowing state. Each state was further split into phases, to allow a more realistic distribution of sojourn times. As these phases and states are unobservable, HPMM was used to calculate the probability of a sow being in given phase using the automatic sensor measures. Thus time to farrowing could be predicted at each time point. The prediction algorithm was validated on a sensor data set for about 35 sows, each followed from day 105 (day-105) since mating until the farrowing. Sensors include sow activity measured by video recording as well as by a photo-cell grid, and water consumption. The algorithm was evaluated using heuristic warning strategies e.g. that a warning should be generated when the expected time to farrowing was less than 12. h (inspired by the regulation of floor heating systems). The performance of the sensors was evaluated. Different combinations of sensor types outperformed the use of a single sensor type. Using a combination of water and activity sensors the prediction algorithm gave a coherent warning period prior to farrowing (true warning) in 97% of the cases. The duration from start of the warning period to farrowing had a mean 11.5 (SD. =. 4.6). h. False warning periods ending before farrowing lasted on average only 0.7. h per sow. The use of HPMM thus allowed a direct prediction of the time to farrowing, handling more than one sensor and a compact representation of historical sensor information. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Automated system; Hidden markov model; Phase-type distribution; Precision livestock; Prediction of onset of farrowing; Sensors","Agriculture; Algorithms; Automation; Heating; Hidden Markov models; Sensors; Video recording; Automated systems; Compact representation; Floor heating systems; Phase type distributions; Precision livestock; Prediction algorithms; Sensor informations; Water consumption; Forecasting; algorithm; livestock farming; Markov chain; monitoring; mortality; numerical model; pig; prediction; sowing; videography; agricultural technology; automation; precision agriculture; sensor"

As a consequence, the process of intensification is gaining momentum. An animal protest group, Dutch Compassion for Animals, claims that automation, and thus also Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), strengthens the trend towards objectifying livestock production animals in this intensification process. This paper describes, analyses and evaluates this claim from an animal ethics perspective. The protest group argues that automation fuels mechanisation and increases in scale, which ultimately results in the transformation of cows from sentient animals into objects. The framework they use to assess this issue from the ethical point of view is problematic. The first problem is that this framework only provides a minimal, negative definition of animal welfare. The second problem is that their conclusion does not belong to a consequentialist framework but to a rival deontological framework. The claim that PLF objectifies animals seems to be unsubstantiated, because it depends on ignoring those PLF capacities that allow a non-stressing focus on individual animals and support increasing levels of animal welfare. Steering PLF in an ethically acceptable direction will be a major task for its developers.","Animal ethics; Animal integrity; Objectification; Production system","Agriculture; Food supply; Machinery; Animal ethics; Animal welfare; Food security; Gaining momentum; Livestock production; Objectification; Precision livestock farming; Production system; Animals"

In this pilot study, the possibility to assess human-animal relationship in a broiler flock using the techniques of precision livestock farming was investigated. Automatic tracking of the activity level of the flock was compared to the human-animal relationship as assessed by a human observer. Two small groups of broilers (Ross 308) were reared for 36 days. One of the groups was treated with additional human contact every day to make the birds more familiar to humans. Welfare assessment according to the Welfare Quality® protocol for poultry (2009) was carried out once a week, with special emphasis on human-animal relationship using the Avoidance Distance Test (ADT). Video recording of the birds' response to the presence of a human was carried out once a week in both groups. The recordings started when a human began walking through the flock. Analysis of the activity of the birds after the human had left the pen was carried out using image analysis software. Activity was for each second expressed as an index between 0 and 1. Results show that the additional human contact group had different values on the ADT-test than the control group: 91 % of total number of birds could be touched compared to 65 %.

Precision Livestock Farming technology might potentially offer a possibility to monitor and reduce the level of aggression and hence its negative impact. This paper reports about the initial part of a larger study investigating the possibilities of applying continuous automatic monitoring of aggressive behaviour among pigs. It investigates how behavioural patterns in pig's aggressive behaviour can be identified and utilized in order to predict severe forms of aggression (biting) expressed in later phases of aggressive interactions.An experiment was carried out at a commercial farm on a group of 11 male pigs weighing on average 23. kg and kept in a pen of 4. m. ×. 2.5. m. During the first 3. days after mixing in total 8. h of video recording were registered with a top view camera for later analysis of animal behaviour. As a result of labelling of the video recordings, 157 aggressive interactions were identified with 12 behaviour types expressed for 860 times within the interactions. The identified interactions were divided into interactions that led to biting and those that did not lead to biting behaviour. The interactions that led to biting behaviour accounted for 36.3% (57) of all aggressive interactions while interactions that did not lead to biting behaviour were 63.7% (100) of the interactions. The average duration of initiating (nosing) phase of aggressive interactions (3.32. s) lasted longer (P<. 0.05) in interactions that led to biting behaviour than in interactions that did not lead to biting behaviour (1.94. s). The next phase of aggressive interactions - medium phase - similarly to initiating phase, lasted on average longer (18.21. s) (P<. 0.01) in interactions that led to biting behaviour than in interactions that did not lead to biting behaviour (16.15. s). With the differences found between interactions that led and did not lead to biting behaviour it seems to be possible to discriminate between both types of interactions in an early phase of aggression. The differences found might serve as early signs in a management support system that aims to prevent severe forms of aggressive behaviour (biting) among pigs. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Aggression; Behaviour; Phases; Pigs","Agriculture; Cameras; Video recording; Aggression; Automatic monitoring; Behaviour; Management support systems; Phases; Pigs; Precision livestock farming; Production system; Mammals; aggression; animal welfare; behavioral ecology; discriminant analysis; livestock; monitoring; videography; Animalia; Suidae"

A computer visionbased system (CVBS) composed of a video-recording system and a cow lying behaviour detector based on the Viola Jones algorithm was developed. The CVBS performance was tested in a head-to-head free stall barn. Two classifiers were implemented in the software component of the CVBS to obtain the cow lying behaviour detector. The CVBS was validated by comparing its detection results with those generated from visual recognition. This comparison allowed the following accuracy indices to be calculated: the branching factor (BF), the miss factor (MF), the sensitivity, and the quality percentage (QP). The MF value of approximately 0.09 showed that the CVBS missed one cow every 11 well detected cows. Conversely, the BF value of approximately 0.08 indicated that one false positive was detected every 13 well detected cows. The high value of approximately 0.92 obtained for the sensitivity index and that obtained for QP of about 0.85 revealed the ability of the proposed system to detect cows lying in the stalls. © Copyright S.M.C.

However, as nowadays it is impossible for a farmer to be present in the farm all day long, automatic monitoring systems are required. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a system (eYeNamic) for automatic monitoring and analyzing broilers’ behavior in a farm. eYeNamic is a camera system introduced and produced by Fancom BV, a company operating in the field of automation of livestock facilities. It includes three cameras located on the ridge of the broiler house and able to monitor chickens’ behaviour twenty-four hours a day. Through eYeNamic it is possible to process the images and to obtain a measure of animals’ distribution and activity, which can be conceived as valuable indicators of animal welfare. The study presented in this paper was divided into several phases: data collection, images visualization, observation of the distribution and activity of the chickens, and statistical analysis of the observations. The analysis of correlation between the number of 14 days old broilers near the feeding line (manual counted) and the average occupation density measured with eYenamic indicates that the best conditions have occurred with a 50 cm by 75 cm area around each feeding pan. With reference to the drinking line, the best response was found in an area 50 cm wide and the whole drinking line long. For the activity behavior, there was no significant correlation between activity and number of chickens eating from all the pans: this confirms that broilers while eating reduce their activity. It was concluded from this study that eYeNamic is a good system to observe animal behavior and, especially, to take care of their drinking and eating behaviour. A satisfactory correspondence between eYeNamic remote and human observations depends on a correct definition of animals’ eating behaviour. In our case, this correspondence is established for the manual labeling, only if a broiler maintains its whole head inside the pan for a period lasting 20 seconds. In many cases the simple closeness to the pan or drinking line does not guarantee that a broiler is eating or drinking. © Copyright A.

PLF consists of measuring animal variables, modeling these data to select information and calculate specific parameters, and then apply these in real time for monitoring and controlling purposes. Computer vision is widely applied in PLF, as well as image analysis techniques that have been used to e.g., automatically detect lameness in dairy cows. Therefore, the performance of such computer vision systems relies on the quality of recorded videos. In particular, the aim of this work was to develop filtering procedures to exclude recorded dairy cow videos of low quality in order to optimize the performance of a lameness detection system based on images. An automatic filtering was developed to remove videos with: 1) Low 3D image quality; 2) Stopping cows or cows not walking smoothly. A top view 3D camera capable of retrieving depth information about cow's body was used to record videos. Regarding the low 3D image quality, filtering was based on certain features extracted from the videos, such as Euler's number, spots ratio, roughness of cow's body contour line and the number of spots around the spine line of a cow. A reference dataset with a total of 313 video instances was manually built up and labeled as low (223 instances) or high quality (90 instances). Furthermore, cows which stopped or did not walk smoothly during video recordings were filtered out from the videos dataset, based on extracted walking indexes from the images. In this case, an additional dataset of 276 videos with 82% normal walking cows and 18% of stopping cows was used as reference for the filtering validation. A decision tree algorithm J.48 was used for classification. The results led to two simplistic filtering algorithms based on a threshold of 0.4% spots ratio and a dimension/ess walking index with value 3. The obtained classification accuracies were about 76% for the low 3D image quality filtering and 91% for cow's walking speed filtering. These filtering results are considered satisfactory in terms of its application on an automated lameness detection system for dairy cows.","3D image; Computer vision; Cow features extraction; Filtering; Video quality; Videos pre-processing; Walking speed","Agriculture; Animals; Computer vision; Decision trees; Filtration; Gait analysis; Image quality; Video recording; 3-D image; Features extraction; Pre-processing; Video quality; Walking speed; Three dimensional"

Thermal image scanner Fluke TiS was used for obtaining 640×480 pixels thermal images with resolution of 0.1 °C. The temperature distribution pattern of different parts of cow's body was estimated and analysed with SmartView software. Special attention was paid to udder, feet and areas with skin injuries. It was estimated that the temperature varies considerably at different parts of the body. Radiation temperature of healthy udder did not change considerably after milking. It means that automatic monitoring of udder temperature is possible not only in milking parlour or milking robot but also in other places where cows are identified. The udder thermograms enable to assess the milking hygiene, as the cleanliness of udder surface influences the measurement results, especially average temperature. The temperature of legs was lowest at the hoofs and highest at coronary band. Differences from this distribution may be used for estimation of leg disorders. Thermal images can be also successfully used for detection of skin injuries. Radiation temperature of injured and depilous locations was higher by several degrees than their surroundings. The study showed that thermal images analysis is promising method to be implemented at precision cattle farming.","Dairy cow; Health; Infrared temperature; Precision livestock farming","Bos; Trematoda"

Especially the information related to feeding/nutritional issues is important, as feeding related costs are always significant part of variables costs for all types of livestock production. Therefore, automating the collection, analysis and use of production related information on livestock farms will be essential for improving livestock productivity in the future. Electronically-controlled livestock production systems with an information and communication technology (ICT) focus are required to ensure that information is collected in a cost effective and timely manner and readily acted upon on farms. New electronic and ICT related technologies introduced on farms as part of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) systems will facilitate livestock management methods that are more responsive to market signals. The PLF technologies encompass methods for electronically measuring the critical components of the production system that indicate the efficiency of resource use, interpreting the information captured and controlling processes to ensure optimum efficiency of both resource use and livestock productivity. These envisaged real-time monitoring and control systems could dramatically improve production efficiency of livestock enterprises. However, further research and development is required, as some of the components of PLF systems are in different stages of development. In addition, an overall strategy for the adoption and commercial exploitation of PLF systems needs to be developed in collaboration with private companies. This article outlines the potential role PLF can play in ensuring that the best possible management processes are implemented on farms to improve farm profitability, quality of products, welfare of livestock and sustainability of the farm environment, especially as it related to intensive livestock species.","Automation; Control systems; Nutrition; Pig farm; Precision feeding; Precision Livestock Farming (PLF); Sensors; Software-based technology","Agricultural markets; Commercial exploitation; Information and Communication Technologies; Pig farms; Precision livestock farming; Production efficiency; Real time monitoring; Research and development; Automation; Commerce; Control systems; Efficiency; Feeding; Food products; Information technology; Nutrition; Process control; Production engineering; Productivity; Profitability; Sensors; Sustainable development; Agriculture"

Although not yet as well developed as the arable sector, 'precision livestock farming' (PLF) technologies (e.g. sensors for oestrus detection, robotic milking systems, automatic liveweight recording) are already starting to help dairy farmers. Currently, most livestock are managed at the group level. PLF aims to monitor individual animals, allowing their individual nutritional as well as health and welfare requirements to be met. Although requiring commercial development, several PLF technologies to monitor and manage extensively-reared animals have been validated scientifically, and could bring considerable production as well as health and welfare benefits to free-ranging animals.

In the case of animal production this includes the following key areas: providing sustainable feed base, reducing environmental impact, feed and food safety and sustainable intensification. Animal production systems can be intensified throughout the application of precision livestock farming (PLF) systems. As the majority of production expenses related to feed, precision nutrition is a key component in PLF systems. Precision nutrition includes the following principles: use of precise nutrient requirement matrix, use of precise ingredient matrix, proper use of modifiers and feed processing technologies and adjustment of nutrient supply to match requirements of livestock.

The concept of precision sheep management is described. This is a system in which sheep are managed as individuals or small groups rather than as a (whole) flock. Precision sheep management utilises the application of radio frequency identification technology, enabling producers to better monitor sheep in extensive situations, and contribute to improved efficiency of management and sheep welfare. Examples of combining radio frequency identification with other technologies such as walk-over-weighing and Pedigree Matchmaker are discussed. These technologies provide producers with tools to improve the cost effectiveness of, and labour efficiency associated with, collecting data on individual animals. The combined technologies should also improve consistency and reliability of information, enhancing decision-making by producers, for example, from regular monitoring of biometric variables such as liveweight, or calculating breeding values to enable superior genetic comparisons over time. © 2012 CSIRO.","labour saving; Pedigree Matchmaker software; RFID identification; technology; walk-over-weighing.","animal welfare; biometry; decision making; extensive agriculture; farming system; livestock farming; precision agriculture; sheep; software; stock assessment; Australia; Animalia; Ovis aries"

Low-cost and infrastructure-less GPS positioning sensors attached to the animals' collars give the opportunity to monitor the movements of cows and recognize cow activities. By preprocessing the raw cow position data, we obtain high classification rates using standard machine learning techniques to recognize cow activities. Our objectives were to (i) determine to what degree it is possible to robustly recognize cow activities from GPS positioning data, using low-cost GPS receivers; and (ii) determine which types of activities can be classified, and what robustness to expect within the different classes.

The proposed approach sees each main component of the actual precision feeding system represented by a virtual domain agent. The agents are then assembled within a multi-agent system that models the automatic precision feeding equipment as a whole. The operational capacity of the virtual prototype is achieved through communication and collaboration between the multiple agents that make up the system. The capacity for dynamic modification of parameters such as workload during the simulation process helps analyze the behavior, robustness and performance of the system prior to its actual use and thus providing a computer-aid tool helping in the design process.

From the HF RFID data, a great degree of variability could be determined in the feeding frequency and feeding duration, which was reflected in the increase in body weight. The pigs classified as High Performers had a significantly higher increase in body weight than the Low Performers. The High Performers also showed an obviously longer time spent each day at the feeder during the first 10 days as well as shorter pauses between their meals.

Sound analysis can also be a tool for supervising the conditions of animal housing. For example, incidences of insufficient feed, water, temperature or the occurrence of diseases can be detected. Starting with a communication model, a sound analysis library for the phonetic analysis of porcine calls was established. As a practical application we have developed an automatic sound classifier for the detection of aversive vocalization of pigs (Stress Monitor and Documentation Unit-STREMODO) which works under practical farming conditions since it selectively filters porcine stress utterances from ambient noise. Furthermore, laboratory procedures were developed to classify various stress vocalizations in different stressful situations. We found minute differences in vocalization resulting from acute pain, fear, frustration or competition for feed. These differences were displayed as small but significant shifts of main energy and altered degrees of noisy components in the frequency-spectrum of the utterances. It has been shown that sophisticated automatic systems for vocalization analysis can be developed when suitable sound models and fast analyses are combined. The resulting data can be easily integrated into a comprehensive monitoring system. They can be used as components indicating deviations from optimum housing and management. Extended knowledge on the fine structure of porcine vocalizations and the integration into automatic detection systems has the potential to result in information tools for farmers that may help reaching a better housing, less stressed animals and, as a result, a better process and product quality as well as enhanced animal welfare.","Animal welfare; Automatic system; Sound analysis; Stress","Animal welfare; Automatic detection systems; Automatic systems; Communication modeling; Comprehensive monitoring; Laboratory procedures; Precision livestock farming; Sound analysis; Animals; Housing; Stresses; Tools"

The rumen animal electron blip was adopted to build a permanent digital file of milk cow in this system and each livestock was labeled with one corresponding file. The cow information stored in electronic tags was identified by RFID technology and PC-SCM technology to make each cow under timely monitoring and management. The results show that the reading rate of RFID system was 100% and the reading distance of which can reach more than eight meters.

Results regarding the proportion of readability (p%), the standard error in readability (SE) and general statistics on the reading time were calculated. Tests for independence based on Chi-square and Pearson's were performed on the categorical data, to estimate the differences between proportions of readability of reading groups. The resulting data was used to define the optimal position of barcodes as well as the optimal reading mode of the barcode scanner to be used for further trials.

Fundamentally, it is argued that order in APS can be created in other ways than by management of livestock farming using the principles and measurement and control technology from process engineering. APS are complex and heterogeneous systems that are part of a food chain and influenced by requirements of consumers, government and civilians. Application of engineering principles to APS covers the study, understanding, management and innovation of these systems. Finally, two possible alternative strategies are presented how PLF can be interpreted and implemented in engineering practices. Firstly, the approach of recursive control as an alternative to traditional control, and secondly the Reflexive Interactive Design approach as a tool to innovate APS in their wider context.","Animal production systems; Engineering principles; Recursive control; Reflexive interactive design","Animal production systems; Engineering practices; Engineering principles; Heterogeneous systems; Interactive design; Measurement and control technology; Precision livestock farming; Recursive control; Production engineering; Animals"

Four strain gauge scales were installed into a milking robot in order to measure the weight of each leg separately and a laser distance sensor was placed next to the robot in order to measure the radial movement of cow's body surface. The sensors were connected to an amplifier and the data was collected into a PC using a dedicated computer program. Three video cameras were installed to observe the system and the data was recorded digitally. From the data the dynamic weight or load of each leg and the respiration rate of the cow can be measured. The average weight, the weight variation of each leg, the total weight, the number of kicks and steps, the frequency of kicks and the total time in the milking robot can be calculated.

The control loop is used to analyse the information flow in the production system. The analysis reveals the distinctions made by livestock keepers, what they consider as information in their production process and upon which rules they base their actions. It shows how far the livestock keepers in resource poor systems are able to control the production, i.e. create order and reduce uncertainty, and which aspects remain uncontrollable to them.

The results are promising because the error of the prediction of the BCS with the camera-based method is on average of the same order of magnitude as the error of the human experts (0.27 vs. 0.25).
