At the same time, Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) technologies, which allow for automated animal monitoring are entering commercial pig farms. With their claim of improving animal health and welfare, these innovations may respond to public concerns. However, they may raise problems of societal acceptance themselves. In this review, we investigate whether the available literature allows for an analysis to which extent PLF can mitigate or reinforce societal concerns related to pig production. We first analyze papers on pig husbandry systems in general, and then those on PLF as an innovation in animal production. In general, there is a tension between citizens and farmers. Citizens hold rather negative attitudes whereas farmers evaluate pig production more positively. Literature on attitudes of other actors, such as veterinarians, is missing. Information on the attitudes toward PLF of stakeholders other than farmers is lacking. Possible challenges of societal acceptance of PLF and chances to overcome these are only discussed in theoretical approaches. We conclude that to analyze the role of PLF in addressing societal concerns over pig production, there is a need for further empirical research including attention to underlying values of all stakeholders. This should focus on the attitudes of the currently missing stakeholders toward pig husbandry in general, and on those of the wider society toward PLF. Only by means of additional data, it will be possible to evaluate whether PLF has the potential to address societal concerns related to pig production. © Copyright © 2021 Giersberg and Meijboom.","attitude; perception; pig production; precision livestock farming; society","agricultural worker; animal experiment; attention; attitude; empirical research; Europe; livestock; nonhuman; perception; pig; review; social acceptance; tension; veterinarian"

They are frequently integrated with other new technologies in order to improve human–livestock interactions, productivity and economical sustainability of modern farms. New systems are constantly being developed for concentrated farming operations as well as for extensive and pasture-based farming systems. The development of technologies for grazing animals is of particular interest for the Mediterranean extensive sheep farming sector. Dairy sheep farming is a typical production system of the area linked to its historical and cultural traditions. The area provides roughly 40% of the world sheep milk, having 27% of the milk-producing ewes. Developed countries of the area (France, Italy, Greece and Spain – FIGS) have highly specialized production systems improved through animal selection, feeding techniques and intensification of production. However, extensive systems are still practiced alongside intensive ones due to their lower input costs and better resilience to market fluctuations. In the current article, we evaluate possible PLF systems and their suitability to be incorporated in extensive dairy sheep farming as practiced in the FIGS countries. Available products include: electronic identification systems (now mandatory in the EU) such as ear tags, ruminal boluses and sub-cutaneous radio-frequency identification; on-animal sensors such as accelerometers, global positioning systems and social activity loggers; and stationary management systems such as walk-over-weights, automatic drafter (AD), virtual fencing and milking parlour-related technologies. The systems were considered according to their suitability for the management and business model common in dairy sheep farming. However, adoption of new technologies does not take place immediately in small and medium scale extensive farming. As sheep farmers usually belong to more conservative technology consumers, characterized by an average age of 60 and a very transparent community, the dynamics do not favour financial risk taking involved with new technologies. Financial barriers linked to production volumes and resource management of extensive farming are also a barrier for innovation. However, future prospectives could increase the importance of technology and promote its wider adoption. Trends such as global sheep milk economics, global warming, awareness to animal welfare, antibiotics resistance and European agricultural policies could influence the farming practices and stimulate wider adoption of PLF systems in the near future. © 2020 The Authors","Extensive farming; Farmer's acceptance; New technologies; Precision livestock farming; Sheep",

It consequently may modify how farmers consider their animals, the quality of the human-animal relationship and animal welfare. To better understand how new technologies impact human-animal relationships on the farm, a survey was carried out on 25 livestock farms in France. The farms raised dairy cows, gestating sows or broiler chickens using different equipment (sensors associated or not with robots). A qualitative thematic analysis to better identify farmers’ views on the different topics, and secondly a statistical analysis to identify if farmer profiles exist and to better understand the diversity of views were conducted. Most of the farmers expressed satisfaction about working with the new technology because their work becomes easier and allows more control over the management of the animals. Using PLF, the farmers describe a profession that has not fundamentally changed but which involves new tasks, new skills and daily schedules. Three farmers’ profiles were identified. Profile A farmers consider that one cannot talk about a human-animal relationship on their farm, and do not enjoy either touching or talking to their animals. Profile B farmers associate a good human-animal relationship with the animals’ welfare. Profile C is characterized by the central place occupied by animals and associate a good human-animal relationship with an absence of fear on the part of the animals. Farmers motivated by animals (profile C) find in precision livestock farming benefits related to animals, while the others (profiles A and B) find technical benefits detached from the animals. The farmers have room to manoeuvre in how they use the equipment; this can be seen for instance in the degree to which tasks are delegated to the equipment, which can be partial or total. Nevertheless, some farmers expressed concerns regarding the place of the new technologies on the farm, such as the risk of losing their own autonomy or their ability to observe animals and detect problems. Complementary studies could monitor these developments and contribute elements on the role of PLF in the sustainability of livestock farms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Human-animal relationship; Livestock farmer profession; Precision livestock farming; Robot; Sensor; Work","accuracy; adult; agricultural worker; animal care; animal welfare; Article; biodiversity; broiler chicken; chicken; controlled study; dairy cattle; France; gestating sows; human; human animal relationship; job satisfaction; livestock; nonhuman; precision livestock farming; priority journal; qualitative analysis; skill; social behavior; sow (swine); statistical analysis; tactile communication; task performance; technology; thematic analysis; touch"

PLF has started being adopted only recently, but the need of technological support on farm is getting more and more important and is facilitating its distribution on farms. A huge number of researches and scientific studies are available in literature about the adoption of technology, sensors and computer tools for almost all reared species. In this literature review, the goal is to study the recent progresses of PLF, and in particular the scientific studies carried out in the last 7 years (2013–2019) on dairy cattle farming. Health, welfare and production aspects were taken into account together with animal behaviour, environmental barn conditions and their effect on the three pillars of sustainability: environmental, economic and social. From the main findings, it can be underlined that PLF brings environmental, economic and social sustainability benefits on farms, but these benefits have not yet been quantified through specific methods for sustainability assessments. Therefore, it is important for near future researches to focus not only on the technological improvements of tools and sensors but also on the aspects of environmental, economic and social sustainability of livestock productions that impact on both farmers and the community and consumers. The role of PLF is more and more important and will support the process of decision-making of farmers, change their role on farm and their management view, and make possible the traceability of products and the control of the quality of products and of the animals living conditions as required from policy-makers and stakeholders. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Data collection; Efficiency improvement; Farm monitoring; Performance indicators; Sensors; Sustainability","Agriculture; Animals; Behavioral research; Decision making; Sensors; Data collection; Efficiency improvement; Performance indicators; Precision livestock farming; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable production; Technological improvements; Technological supports; Sustainable development"

Since animals act based on habits, the real-time monitoring data logger has become an indispensable instrument to assist farmers in recognizing the status of livestock. Position-tracked and acoustic monitoring have become commonplace as two of the best methods to characterize feeding performance in ruminants. Previously, the existing methods were limited to desktop computers and lacked a sound-collecting function. These restrictions impacted the late interventions from feeders and required a large-sized data memory. In this work, an open-source framework for a data collector that autonomously captures the health information of farm animals is introduced. In this portable hardware, a Wireless Location Acoustic Sensing System (WiLASS) is integrated to infer the health status through the activities and abnormal phenomena of farming livestock via chew–bite sound identification. WiLASS involves the open modules of ESP32-WROOM, GPS NEO-6M, ADXL335 accelerometer, GY-MAX4466 amplifier, temperature sensors, and other signal processing circuits. By means of wireless communication, the ESP32-WROOM Thing micro-processor offers high speed transmission, standard protocol, and low power consumption. Data are transferred in a real-time manner from the attached sensing modules to a digital server for further analysis. The module of GPS NEO-6M Thing brings about fast tracking, high precision, and a strong signal, which is suitable for highland applications. Some computations are incorporated into the accelerometer to estimate directional movement and vibration. The GY-MAX4466 Thing plays the role of microphone, which is used to store environmental sound. To ensure the quality of auditory data, they are recorded at a minimum sampling frequency of 10 KHz and at a 12-bit resolution. Moreover, a mobile software in pocket devices is implemented to provide extended mobility and social convenience. Converging with a cloud-based server, the multi-Thing portable platform can provide access to simultaneously supervise. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol with low bandwidth, high reliability, and bi-direction, and which is appropriate for most operating systemsOS, is embedded into the system to prevent data loss. From the experimental results, the feasibility, effectiveness, and correctness of our approach are verified. Under the changes of climate, the proposed framework not only supports the improvement of farming techniques, but also provides a high-quality alternative for poor rural areas because of its low cost and its ability to carry out a proper policy for each species. © 2020 by the authors.

Literature gives insufficient anchor points to estimate the value of information (VOI) obtained with PLF technologies. This study proposes a conceptual framework with building blocks to determine the VOI. Next, the framework is used to describe factors and existing gaps in the VOI assessment. This, finally, leads to reflections and recommendations about how to assess and improve the VOI of PLF. Literature reveals that the VOI surpasses the mere use of more precise information to take decisions, but encompasses a path from data collection to decisions with particular outcomes. The framework interlinks three building blocks: (i) data processing, (ii) decision making and (iii) impact analysis with factors influencing the VOI such as the process to transform data into information, level of precision, decision rules, social influences, the accuracy of information, herd size and prevalence of the condition measured. Besides profitability, outcomes from decisions include the impact on animal welfare, environment, food safety, and food security. The data-to-value framework allows for a better assessment of VOI and its potentials, and provides anchor points to design useful and valuable PLF technologies. The framework also helps to determine the role of advisors in interpreting the more precise information and in formulating farmer-tailored advice to apply the most optimal practices. Both technology design and advisors’ role may enhance the VOI of future PLF developments and applications. © 2019","Conceptual framework; Economic analysis; Precision livestock farming; Role of advisors; Value of information","accuracy assessment; assessment method; conceptual framework; data processing; detection method; economic analysis; livestock; livestock farming; technological development; Animalia"

A research gap exists regarding the impact of data-driven smart farming on the relationship between advisors and farmers, and advisors and farm data/technology. Therefore, we asked: how are farmers and advisors interacting with data-driven smart farming, and what are the implications for farm advisor capability and roles in a future where farmers use more data-driven smart farming? We studied advisory roles, advisor-farmer interactions, and new technologies in the context of three case studies: i) automated cow body condition scoring in New Zealand; ii) precision grazing management in New Zealand; and iii) the Soil Water Outlook tool in the Australian grains and lamb sectors. We propose a conceptual framework involving on-farm adaptation, learning, capability development and organizational roles. The findings show that smart technologies exhibit potentially disruptive features for farm management, necessitating greater input from a farmer's advisory network to facilitate optimal farm system adaptation. This has implications for the nature of the advisory relationship, where advisory capabilities evolve to include skills on determining technology value propositions alongside farmers and new skills are built for linking data to better decision-making on farm. This paper contributes to improved understanding of how back-office advisory roles may move from information gathering, to remote data interpretation due to data-driven smart farming. We identify the advisor's role in acting as a sensemaker in the smart farming innovation system, rather than a promoter or barrier to technology uptake. Further adaptation of advisory practices is required to enable greater value from data-driven smart farming to be captured by farmers. © 2019 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences","Advisors; Data-driven decisions; Smart farming; Social interaction; Trust","agricultural development; agricultural extension; agricultural technology; body condition; data interpretation; decision making; grazing management; livestock farming; social structure; soil water; technological development; New Zealand; Animalia"

More efficient use of precision technology has been identified as a potential way of addressing this problem. The mandatory requirement for Electronic Identification (EID) tags to be placed on all sheep offers an opportunity for sheep farmers to adopt precision technologies to manage herd health and maximise production and profit. Although the charactistics of farmers that are associated with adoption or non adoption of technology have been identified little is known about the social processes, meanings and experiences that influence uptake. This paper is novel as it draws on data from 36 sheep farmers in the UK and applies Normalization Process Theory (NPT) to gain an understanding of the reasons they do or do not use EID related precision technology on their farms. The interviews were tape recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using NVivo. Although respondents acknowledged the potential value of precision technology to improve their farm businesses they appeared to have alternative beliefs that were counter productive. Their beliefs that using precision technology posed a threat to their role as a good stockman, that it could not replace the need for hands-on interaction with their animals and that it was costly and difficult to use created an implementation gap. The use of NPT as an evaluation framework provided a valuable tool for increasing the understanding of contextual characteristics that undermine the routine embedding of such technology by sheep farmers. The data suggests that normalisation of the use of precision technology amongst sheep farmers could potentially be increased if manufacturers/suppliers co-design and work with farmer's to ensure that the technology enables the farmer to be in control and operates as an aid to achieving high quality stockmanship rather than a mechanism for profit maximisation. © 2019 The Authors","Attitudes; Decision making; Flock management; Normalisation Process Theory; Precsion livestock farming; Sheep; Social science","adoption; adult; agricultural land; agricultural worker; animal experiment; article; decision making; embedding; female; genetic transcription; interview; livestock; male; nonhuman; profit; sheep; sociology; agricultural worker; animal; animal husbandry; animal identification; attitude; devices; England; human; middle aged; psychology; sheep; technology; veterinary medicine; Wales; Adult; Animal Husbandry; Animal Identification Systems; Animals; Attitude; England; Farmers; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Sheep; Technology; Wales"

There are number of reasons which causes less yield in the agriculture such as unpredictable environmental conditions, excess use of fertilizers (cost is increasing day by day), increased draught frequency and its severity, increasing labor rate, less difference between the income and expenditure, ripeness of soil, influenced suspensions, non-appropriate water management, diseases on crops, invasion of animals and so on. There is need to find the ways which makes the use of Information Technology (IT) concepts and tools wherever possible for increasing automation in the agriculture business, which results in the efficient and effective outcome of agriculture i.e. higher yields. The production efficiency can be increased significantly with technological advancement in agriculture. Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel design approach for precision farming. Farming has seen number of technological transformations in the last decade. By using various smart agriculture gadgets, farmers have gained better control over the process of raising the growing crops and livestocks.

In the last part of the online survey, respondents were asked for their spontaneous associations with pictures showing digital farming technologies for animal husbandry. In their general attitude toward digital farming technologies, respondents are mostly positive. The approval of the use of sensors for livestock farming and even the consent for public funding of famers using these sensors is high.

Thermal stress events can cause reduced performance, morbidity, and mortality, resulting in significant economic losses and animal welfare concerns. Environment control in confined animal housing systems is typically based on heat and moisture production rates at predetermined ambient temperature levels measured between 1950 and 1980. This traditional control method can fall short in meeting the true thermal needs of the animals since it does not account for factors now acknowledged as affecting the animal's productive responses to surrounding conditions, such as humidity, drafts, radiation, physiological state, and social interactions. Also, advancements in animal genetics, nutrition, and management practices have led to considerable changes in sensible and latent heat loads of modern livestock buildings. In this context, precision livestock farming technologies (sensors, detectors, cameras, microphones, etc.), enabling the automatic monitoring of environmental, physiological, and behavioural variables, can be used to continuously assess livestock performance and well-being in relation to their environment. An innovative strategy for environment control of livestock buildings could include the analysis of: (i) heat and moisture production rates using the most recent bioenergetic models; (ii) thermal stress through multi-factor animal comfort indices based on some environmental and physiological measurements; and (iii) animal behaviour as a response to changing environmental conditions.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the economic benefits of investment in a sensor system for oestrus detection (pedometer or activity meter) in different dairy farming systems in France. A stochastic dynamic model was used to simulate all the physiological and management processes occurring in a dairy operation. Seven French dairy farms with different breeds (Holstein, Montbéliarde and Normande), size (30 to 119 cows), milk price (conventional or protected designation of origin) and calving strategies (grouped or continuous calving) were simulated. Six scenarios with different oestrus detection rates (50% before and 90% after use of the equipment) and percentage of cows equipped (40%-80%-100%) were applied to each farm. The internal rate of return was used to evaluate the economic benefits of the investment. It was estimated that the system for transmitting and analysing data from pedometer and activity meter systems would cost €6,498 and €4,430 respectively. The use of an automatic oestrus detection device reduced the calving interval by between 7d (herds with Normande cows) and 23d (herds with Holstein cows) and increased the annual gross margin per cow by between €8 (small herd with Normande cows) and €92 (herd with Montbéliarde cows). The investment appeared profitable in two-thirds of the situations, characterised by high milk prices, large herd size or low percentage of cows equipped. These results suggest that the return on investment should be estimated at each farm level. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Thus, perceiving animal information and behaviors are fundamental to precision livestock farming. A research review of respiration detection, locomotion score, body condition score, individual identification, behavioral analysis, etc. were summarized focusing on large animals, including cows, pigs, sheep, which are prevalent instock farming industry. And a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of different methods applied in all the aspects was presented in this review. In term of individual information acquisition and analysis(e.g., individual identification and body condition score), solutions based on 3D camera and depth image processing technolygy were emphasized, because such cameras were more robust to the environment when extracting the animal target from the image. In addition, locomotion score was one of the most important topics in precision livestock farming. Electronic sensors, audio recorder and digital cameras were used to perceive the individual information and prove feasible to detect the animals' lameness automatically. Because of the earlier lameness detection requirements of practical application, the pathology of the limbs and hooves disease, the automatic trauma detection and universal parameters of lameness without scoring system should be considered in the future. In the behavior analysis aspect, some new research approaches were emphasized including the limb segmentation algorithm and the combination with human behavior analysis theory and method. Considering the development trend and requirements of practical application in precision farming, animals' social behavior should be considered. The precision live farming should also consider the effectiveness, robustness and the stress to animals of the detection equipments, continue to move in contactless, high precision and automation direction. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

Among the important factors in achieving improved efficiency is the provision of an optimal building environment with low Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) emissions. The present paper summarises the main results of a national (Greek) project running under the auspices of the General Secretariat for Research and Technology. The GreenPoultry project tackles a subject of great economical and social importance for the Greek regions, especially for those where livestock operations are very intense (e.g. Epirus). Poultry breeding constitutes the most dynamic sector of Greek stock-raising representing 5% of the agricultural economy and 10% of the animal sector, while the number of raised birds has increased 75% during the last three decades. In parallel, poultry farms are considered as major rural pollutants and energy consumers. The main goal of the GreenPoultry project was to reduce the environmental footprint of poultry facilities through a sustainable reduction of released air pollutants and GHGs along with a decrease in energy consumption. This was achieved among others through the use of precision livestock farming (PLF) techniques. A set of wireless sensors for measuring environmental and climate parameters was installed in commercial poultry farms. Project's results include best design techniques concerning the poultry facility construction (i.e. building geometry and construction materials, ventilation techniques, dimensionalizing, positioning and operation strategy of E/M systems, etc.) that can lead to favorable indoor microclimate and energy reduction.","Computational fluid dynamics; Energy audits; Environmental footprint; Greece; Poultry production; Wireless network","Building materials; Computational fluid dynamics; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Pollution; Wireless networks; Wireless sensor networks; Agricultural economy; Energy audit; Environmental footprints; Environmental-friendly; Greece; Livestock operations; Poultry production; Precision livestock farming; Agriculture"
