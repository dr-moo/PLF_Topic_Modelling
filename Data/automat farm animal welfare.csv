In dairy farming, particular attention is paid to the automatic cow detection and tracking, as such information is closely related to animal welfare and thus to possible health issues. Computer vision represents a suitable and promising method for this purpose. This paper describes the first step for the development of a computer vision system, based on deep learning, aiming to recognize in real-time the individual cows, detect their positions, actions and movements and record the time history outputs for each animal. Specifically, a neural network based on deep learning techniques has been trained and validated on a case study farm, for the automatic recognition of individual cows in videos recorded in the barn. Four cows were selected to train and validate a YOLO neural network able to recognize a cow starting from the coat pattern. Then, precision-recall curves of the identification of individual cows were elaborated for both the specific target classes and the whole dataset in order to assess the performances of the network. By means of data augmentation techniques, an enlarged dataset has been created and considered in order to improve the performance of the network and to provide indications to increase detection efficiency in those cases where data acquisition is not easy to be carried out for long periods. The mean average precision of the detection, ranging from 0.64 to 0.66, showed that it is possible to properly identify individual cows based on their morphological appearance and that the piebald spotting pattern of a cow's coat represents a clearly distinguishable object for a computer vision network. The results also led to obtain indications about the quantity and the characteristics of the images to be used for the network training in order to achieve efficient detections when facing with applications involving animals. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Computer vision; Dairy cow; Deep learning; Herd management; Precision livestock farming","Animals; Computer vision; Data acquisition; Farm buildings; Learning systems; Neural networks; Automatic recognition; Computer vision system; Detection and tracking; Detection efficiency; Efficient detection; Identification of individuals; Learning techniques; Precision livestock farming; Deep learning"

Assessing elements of animal behaviour under domesticated conditions in comparison to natural behaviours found in wild settings has the potential to address issues of animal welfare effectively, such as focusing on reproduction and production success. This review discusses and evaluates to what extent social network analysis (SNA) can be incorporated with sensor-based data collection methods, and what impact the results may have concerning welfare assessment and future farm management processes. The effectiveness and critical features of automated sensor-based technologies deployed in farms include tools for measuring animal social group interactions and the monitoring and recording of farm animal behaviour using SNA. Comparative analyses between the quality of sensor-collected data and traditional observa-tional methods provide an enhanced understanding of the behavioural dynamics of farm animals. The effectiveness of sensor-based approaches in data collection for farm animal behaviour measure-ment offers unique opportunities for social network research. Sensor-enabled data in livestock SNA addresses the biological aspects of animal behaviour via remote real-time data collection, and the results both directly and indirectly influence welfare assessments, and farm management processes. Finally, we conclude with potential implications of SNA on modern animal farming for improvement of animal welfare. © 2021 by the authors.

AMS have the potential to increase the effectiveness of the milking process and sustain animal welfare. This study assessed the state of the art of research activities on AMS through a systematic review of scientific and industrial research. The papers and patents of the last 20 years (2000–2019) were analysed to assess the research tendencies. The words appearing in title, abstract and keywords of a total of 802 documents were processed with the text mining tool. Four clusters were identified (Components, Technology, Process and Animal). For each cluster, the words frequency analysis enabled us to identify the research tendencies and gaps. The results showed that focuses of the scientific and industrial research areas complementary, with scientific papers mainly dealing with topics related to animal and process, and patents giving priority to technology and components. Both scientific and industrial research converged on some crucial objectives, such as animal welfare, process sustainability and technological development. Despite the increasing inter-est in animal welfare, this review highlighted that further progress is needed to meet the consumers’ demand. Moreover, milk yield is still regarded as more valuable compared to milk quality. There-fore, additional effort is necessary on the latter. At the process level, some gaps have been found related to cleaning operations, necessary to improve milk quality and animal health. The use of farm data and their incorporation on herd decision support systems (DSS) appeared optimal. The results presented in this review may be used as an overall assessment useful to address future research. © 2021 by the authors.

There is limited research related to longitudinal adoption patterns of precision dairy technologies and reasons for any patterns. The aim of this analysis was to investigate trends in technology adoption regarding both the amount (number of farms with a technology) and intensity (number of technologies per farm) of adoption. Surveys of parlor technology adoption were conducted on New Zealand dairy farms in 2008, 2013, and 2018, with 532, 500, and 500 respondents, respectively. Technologies were grouped into labor-saving (LS, such as automatic cluster removers) or data-capture (DC, such as in-line milk meters) categories. Trends were examined for farms that had only LS, only DC, or LS+DC technologies. Technology adoption increased over time; the likelihood of technology adoption in 2018 (and 2013 in parentheses) increased by 21 (22), 7 (68), and 378% (165) for LS, DC, and LS+DC technology groups, respectively, compared to 2008. Farms with LS+DC technologies also had a greater proportion of LS technologies compared to non-LS+DC farms, although this relationship declined over the 10-yr period. The use of a rotary versus herringbone parlor was estimated to be associated with 356 and 470% increase in the likelihood of adopting LS technologies and LS+DC, respectively, from 2008 to 2018. Regional differences in adoption were also found, with the likelihood of adopting DC and LS+DC technologies found to be 46 and 59% greater, respectively, in the South Island of New Zealand, compared to the base region of Waikato. The results highlight the importance of understanding spatial and temporal farm characteristics when considering future effect and adoption of precision dairy technologies. For example, the analysis indicates the occurrence of 2 trajectories to technology investment on farms, where larger farms are able to take advantage of technology opportunities, but smaller farms may be constrained by factors such as lack of economies of scale, limited capital to invest, and inability to retrofit technology into aging parlor infrastructure. © 2021 American Dairy Science Association","adoption; dairy; data capture; investment; labor saving; technology","adoption; adult; aging; agricultural land; article; female; human; human experiment; investment; major clinical study; male; milk; New Zealand; pasture"

This study investigated whether training heifers on an AMS phantom provides the possibility of preparing heifers for the following lactation at the AMS. For this purpose, 77 Holstein-Friesian heifers were randomly assigned to one of 2 experimental groups: control (CON) or phantom (PHAN). Four weeks before calving, the PHAN group was given free access to the phantom, which was similar to the actual milking robot, so that they could explore it and be positively conditioned by feeding concentrate in the phantom. The heifers of the CON group had no contact with the phantom or the AMS before the first milking at the AMS. The milking frequency per animal per day was recorded, and the proportion of animals that had to be fetched for milking was determined, to evaluate how the animals accepted the AMS after calving. To assess the stress level of the animals before and after introduction into the AMS, fecal cortisol concentrations and rumination times of the animals were measured. Additionally, lactation performance characteristics (milk yield, milk flow, electrical conductivity of milk, and milk composition) were recorded for 77 animals. The animals trained on the phantom showed a higher milking frequency (DIM 7: 2.70 ± 0.14 visits/d) than the control animals (DIM 7: 2.41 ± 0.14 visits/d) between the 4th and 10th day of lactation. In addition, between d 1 and d 5, the proportion of animals that had to be fetched for milking was lower in PHAN (DIM 1: 35.18 ± 4.16%) than in CON (DIM 1: 48.03 ± 4.46%). The PHAN heifers had unexpectedly high fecal cortisol levels (1 wk prepartum: 43.50 ± 0.93 ng/g of feces), although not considerably elevated compared with CON (1 wk prepartum: 40.76 ± 1.05 ng/g of feces). Training on the phantom had no appreciable influence on rumination time and lactation performance parameters. The increased number of milking visits and the reduced proportion of animals that had to be fetched into the AMS for milking indicate that training on the phantom prepares the animals well for being milked in the AMS. Therefore, training heifers on the phantom offers the possibility to facilitate the start into early lactation for the animals, providing a valuable contribution to improvement of animal welfare. © 2021 American Dairy Science Association","adaptation; automatic milking; cortisol; heifer",

The study included a herd of 65 Polish Holstein Friesian black and white cows used in a free-range barn located in south-west Poland. The animals were kept in proper welfare conditions, fed using the partly mixed ration (PMR) method on the feeding table. The milk was obtained using the Lely-Astronaut A4 Automatic Milking System (AMS). The animals on the dairy cattle farm were used in the range from the first to the seventh lactation, i.e., at the age of 2.0 to approximately 10 years. In this study, the amount of milk yielded from the hind quarters was statistically significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the trait determined for the front quarters. At the same time, the milk flow rate was statistically significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the front quarters compared to the rear quarters. The daily milk yield in right rear (RR) and left rear (LR) hind quarters was higher by 1.0 kg of milk, respectively, than in right front (RF) and left front (LF) fore quarters. The milking time of the RR and LR hind quarters during the day was longer by 104.9 and 128.8 s, respectively, than the RF and LF fore quarters. The milking speed of the RR and LR hind quarters during the day was lower by 0.2 and 1.12 g/s, respectively, than in the RF and LF fore quarters. The values of the correlation between the yields of milk and its components obtained in this study were high and positive. Correlations between the milk yield and the content of its components were negative. The obtained results confirmed that the natural physiological variability of the udder and teats structure, as well as the course of lactation, significantly affects the individual composition and milk flow during milking. The ability to regulate the milk flow by adjusting the appropriate negative pressure during the robot’s operation, in the observed variability of individual lobes of the mammary gland, increases the efficiency of milking and, as a result, reduces the risk of mastitis in cows. © MDPI AG.

Here, we review and compare three well-known systems that operate at farm level from around the world (FARM, Welfare Quality®, and The Code of Welfare) and discuss their advantages and limitations. Despite having some commonalities, the programs evaluate different elements. We also briefly review an emerging system (Integrated Diagnostic Welfare System) that might address some of the shortcomings of the existing systems, especially the possibility of automating the evaluation of animal well-being and identifying any cause of poor welfare. None of the aforementioned systems has been fully validated for their ability to assess animal welfare using independent measurements. The future holds increased attention around the well-being of dairy cows and increased use of sensing technologies. There is an urgent need for dairy welfare evaluation systems that are scientifically validated, holistic, and that can take advantage of the use of sensing technologies to continuously monitor animal welfare.

However, there is still a need to integrate data from single sources to obtain a complete picture of the welfare of an animal. This review offers a basis for developing integrated automatic systems to assess dairy cow welfare by providing an overview of the main issues that challenge cow welfare (e.g., lameness) and of well-established indicators that could detect these issues on the farm. Based on a literature review of 4 reviews on cow welfare in general and 48 reviews on single welfare issues, we identified 18 different major welfare issues and 76 matching indicators that could be detected automatically on the farm. Several indicators, e.g., feed intake, showed a consistent association with welfare across many different issues. Although some of these indicators are discussed critically, this means there are many indicators that potentially could detect reduced welfare in general. Other types of indicators could detect one specific welfare issue, e.g., increased respiratory rate for heat stress. These different types of indicators combined provide a basis to develop integrated automatic systems that ultimately would help farmers to detect welfare problems at an early stage. © 2020 by the authors.

The presented literature clearly demonstrates that lameness is a major health issue in dairy herds, compromising dairy cow welfare and productivity, and resulting in significant economic implications for dairy farmers. Despite this, dairy farmers fail to perceive lameness as a serious threat to their dairy business. This restricted perception of the importance of lameness may be a product of limited ability to detect lame cows. Many automated lameness detection technologies have been proposed to assist dairy farmers in managing their herds. However, limitations such as cost, performance and dairy farmer perception of the usefulness of these technologies, has lead to poor uptake. It can, therefore, be concluded that there is a need to more thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of these technologies under on-farm conditions, potentially in the form of a demonstration farm network. This will allow generation of the necessary data required to show dairy farmers that these technologies are reliable and are economically rational for their dairy business.

Automatic identification of individual animals is an important step to achieve individualised care in terms of disease detection and control, and improvement of the food quality. For example, as feeding patterns can differ amongst pigs in the same pen, even in homogenous groups, automatic registration shows the most potential when applied to an individual pig. In the EU for instance, this capability is required for certification purposes. Although the RFID technology has been gradually developed and widely applied for this task, chip implanting might still be time-consuming and costly for current practical applications. In this paper, a novel framework composed of computer vision algorithms, machine learning and deep learning techniques is proposed to offer a relatively low-cost and scalable solution of pig recognition. Firstly, pig faces and eyes are detected automatically by two Haar feature-based cascade classifiers and one shallow convolutional neural network to extra high-quality images. Secondly, face recognition is performed by employing a deep convolutional neural network. Additionally, class activation maps generated by grad-CAM and saliency maps are utilised to visually understand how the discriminating parameters have been learned by the neural network. By applying the proposed approach on 10 randomly selected pigs filmed in farm condition, the proposed method demonstrates the superior performance against the state-of-art method with an accuracy of 83% over 320 testing images. The outcome of this study will facilitate the real-application of AI-based animal identification in swine production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CNN; Computer vision; Deep learning; Face detection; Face recognition; Machine learning","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Automatic identification; Classification (of information); Computer vision; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Disease control; Learning systems; Mammals; Quality control; Animal identification; Automatic registration; Cascade classifiers; Computer vision algorithms; High quality images; Identification of individuals; Learning techniques; State-of-art methods; Face recognition; artificial neural network; certification; computer vision; detection method; European Union; identification method; machine learning; quality control; Animalia; Suidae"

It is caused by protozoa of the genus Eimeria, which cause concrete economic losses due to malabsorption, bad feed conversion rate, reduced weight gain, and increased mortality. The greatest damage is registered in commercial poultry farms because birds are reared together in large numbers and high densities. Unfortunately, these enteric pathologies are not preventable, and their diagnosis is only available when the disease is full-blown. For these reasons, the preventive use of anticoccidials—some of these with antimicrobial action—is a common practice in intensive farming, and this type of management leads to the release of drugs in the environment which contributes to the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance. Due to the high relevance of this issue, the early detection of any health problem is of great importance to improve animal welfare in intensive farming. Three prototypes, previously calibrated and adjusted, were developed and tested in three different experimental poultry farms in order to evaluate whether the system was able to identify the coccidia infection in intensive poultry farms early. For this purpose, a data-driven machine learning algorithm was built, and specific critical values of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were found to be associated with abnormal levels of oocystis count at an early stage of the disease. This result supports the feasibility of building an automatic data-driven machine learning algorithm for an early warning of coccidiosis. © 2020 by the authors.

Cortisol expression can be combined with other measures to assess stress: saliva and hair have the advantage of requiring minimally invasive sampling. No work has investigated the long-term impact of introduction of AMS. The aims of the study were to assess short-term and chronic stress associated with a change in milking system by measuring salivary and hair cortisol levels and to assess the impact on health and production parameters. Cows from one farm changing their milking system were recruited to the study and sampled for saliva (n = 10) and hair (n = 12) before and after installation. Cortisol levels were measured using a salivary cortisol enzyme immunoassay kit. Body condition, lameness and milk parameters of the whole herd were regularly assessed. Salivary cortisol showed no diurnal pattern but was affected by lameness and gestation. Non-lame cows showed a reduction in salivary cortisol after AMS introduction (p < 0.001). Hair cortisol levels increased after AMS, but it was unclear if this change was seasonal. Milk yield increased by 13% and somatic cell count reduced by 28%. Body condition score was consistently good, but lameness remained high throughout the study. Production values alone do not represent high welfare.

This has consequences in how easily a farmer can supervise his herd and may be detrimental to animal welfare, specifically regarding social relations, time budget and area of residence. An automated tracking system can support the farmer in his management activities and can provide the foundation for a scientific assessment of the welfare consequences of large groups. In this study, a relatively simple and inexpensive real time location system (RTLS) was developed with the aim of achieving precise localization of several tags (animals) in real time and in a real barn environment. The RTLS was based on the ultra-wideband (UWB) technology provided by DecaWave and was adapted for a time difference of arrival (TDoA) procedure to estimate the tags’ positions. The RTLS can handle up to a hundred tags simultaneously using a Pure ALOHA random access method at 1-second intervals. The localization of the tags was estimated in 2D on a given fixed height using a constrained Gauss-Newton algorithm to increase accuracy and stability. The performance of the overall system was evaluated in two different dairy barns. To determine the precision of the system, static and dynamic positions measured at withers height of a cow (1.5 m) and closer to the ground mimicking a lying cow were compared with a reference system (theodolite). The 2D deviations between the systems were used as a measure of precision. In addition, the scalability in respect to the number of tags and the size of the observed area was examined in situations with ten tags and the situation with 100 tags was simulated with a ten-fold increase in sampling rate. According to the field test, the system as developed can be used for the individual localization of animals. At withers height, most of the measured locations deviated less than 0.5 m from the localizations as measured by the theodolite. At lower heights, and closer to the corners of the observed area, some localization estimates were somewhat larger. This was also the case close to large metal barn infrastructure. The measured collision rate of 11% for 100 tags was low. In spite of its low price, the system as a whole is therefore promising and ready for a next step, which should include the observation of large groups of real animals on working farms. © 2020 The Authors","Large groups; Precision farming; Realtime location systems (RTLS); Time difference of arrival (TDOA); Ultra-wide band (UWB)","Animals; Budget control; Dairies; Farm buildings; Location; Time difference of arrival; Automated tracking; Gauss-Newton algorithm; Large groups; Management activities; Precision farming; Real time location systems; Real-time location; Ultra-wideband technology; Ultra-wideband (UWB); accuracy assessment; algorithm; animal welfare; commercial activity; dairy farming; environmental conditions; estimation method; farming system; management practice; performance assessment; precision; real time; Animalia"

However, it is critical and challenging to maintain the health and welfare of the increasing population of dairy cattle, especially the dairy calf (up to 20% mortality in China). Animal behaviors reflect considerable information and are used to estimate animal health and welfare. In recent years, machine vision-based methods have been applied to monitor animal behaviors worldwide. Collected image or video information containing animal behaviors can be analyzed with computer languages to estimate animal welfare or health indicators. In this proposed study, a new deep learning method (i.e., an integration of background-subtraction and inter-frame difference) was developed for automatically recognizing dairy calf scene-interactive behaviors (e.g., entering or leaving the resting area, and stationary and turning behaviors in the inlet and outlet area of the resting area) based on computer vision-based technology. Results show that the recognition success rates for the calf’s science-interactive behaviors of pen entering, pen leaving, staying (standing or laying static behavior), and turning were 94.38%, 92.86%, 96.85%, and 93.51%, respectively. The recognition success rates for feeding and drinking were 79.69% and 81.73%, respectively. This newly developed method provides a basis for inventing evaluation tools to monitor calves’ health and welfare on dairy farms. © 2020 by the authors.

Infrared thermography (IRT) is one such technology that has been used for monitoring animal health and welfare and, through automation, has the potential to be integrated into automated systems on-farm. This study reports on an automated system for collecting thermal infrared images of calves and on the development and validation of an algorithm capable of automatically detecting and analysing the eye and cheek regions from those images. Thermal infrared images were collected using an infrared camera integrated into an automated calf feeder. Images were analysed automatically using an algorithm developed to determine the maximum eye and cheek (3 × 3-pixel and 9 × 9-pixel areas) temperatures in a given image. Additionally, the algorithm determined the maximum temperature of the entire image (image maximum temperature). In order to validate the algorithm, a subset of 350 images analysed using the algorithm were also analysed manually. Images analysed using the algorithm were highly correlated with manually analysed images for maximum image (R2 = 1.00), eye (R2 = 0.99), cheek 3 × 3-pixel (R2 = 0.85) and cheek 9 × 9-pixel (R2 = 0.90) temperatures. These findings demonstrate the algorithm to be a suitable method of analysing the eye and cheek regions from thermal infrared images. Validated as a suitable method for automatically detecting and analysing the eye and cheek regions from thermal infrared images, the integration of IRT into automated on-farm systems has the potential to be implemented as an automated method of monitoring calf health and welfare. © 2020 by the authors.

Automated tracking of animals has been successful in controlled laboratory settings, but recording from animals in large groups in highly variable farm settings presents challenges. The aim of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the advances that have occurred in automated, high throughput image detection of farm animal behavioural traits with welfare and production implications. Peer-reviewed publications written in English were reviewed systematically following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. After identification, screening, and assessment for eligibility, 108 publications met these specifications and were included for qualitative synthesis. Data collected from the papers included camera specifications, housing conditions, group size, algorithm details, procedures, and results. Most studies utilized standard digital colour video cameras for data collection, with increasing use of 3D cameras in papers published after 2013. Papers including pigs (across production stages) were the most common (n = 63). The most common behaviours recorded included activity level, area occupancy, aggression, gait scores, resource use, and posture. Our review revealed many overlaps in methods applied to analysing behaviour, and most studies started from scratch instead of building upon previous work. Training and validation sample sizes were generally small (mean±s.d. groups = 3.8±5.8) and in data collection and testing took place in relatively controlled environments. To advance our ability to automatically phenotype behaviour, future research should build upon existing knowledge and validate technology under commercial settings and publications should explicitly describe recording conditions in detail to allow studies to be reproduced. © 2019 Wurtz et al.

Therefore, timely detection of these diseases is of paramount importance in poultry production. This study proposes a machine vision-based monitoring system for broiler chicken as they walk through a test area. Data were collected from two groups of broilers; control group and treatment group (inoculated intramuscularly with virulent Newcastle disease virus) housed in fully isolated chambers for comparative monitoring. The broilers were monitored by video surveillance for data labelling and depth camera for the automated health status classifier development. Feature variables were extracted based on 2D posture shape descriptors (circle variance, elongation, convexity, complexity, and eccentricity) and mobility feature (walk speed). A statistical analysis of the feature variables established that all investigated features were statistically significant (p<0.05) with time after challenge in the treatment group. The earliest possible infection detection time was on the 4th day based on circle variance and elongation, and the 6th day based on eccentricity and walk speed. However, convexity and complexity could not provide early detection. Two sets of classifiers were then developed based on only the posture shape descriptors, and on all the feature variables, The Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM) outperformed all the other models with an accuracy of 0.975 and 0.978 respectively. The proposed system can serve as an automatic broiler monitoring system by providing an early warning and prediction of an occurrence of disease continuously and non-intrusively. © 2019 IAgrE","Mobility; Posture; Poultry welfare; Shape descriptors; Support vector machine","Animals; Carrier mobility; Disease control; Monitoring; Security systems; Speed control; Steel beams and girders; Support vector machines; Viruses; Early warning and prediction; Machine vision systems; Monitoring system; Newcastle disease virus; Posture; Poultry production; Shape descriptors; Video surveillance; Computer vision"

However, a lack of suffering does not guarantee that animals are experiencing a positive welfare state. The aim of the present review is to identify promising valid and reliable animal-based indicators for the ssessment of positive welfare that might be included in welfare assessment protocols for ruminants, and to discuss them in the light of the five domains model, highlighting possible gaps to be filled by future research. Based on the existing literature in the main databases, each indicator was evaluated in terms of its validity, reliability, and on-farm feasibility. Some valid indicators were identified, but a lot of the validity evidence is based on their absence when a negative situation is present; furthermore, only a few indicators are available in the domains of Nutrition and Health. Reliability has been seldom addressed. On-farm easibility could be increased by developing specific sampling strategies and/or relying on the use of video- or automatic-recording devices. In conclusion, several indicators are potentially available (e.g., synchronisation of lying and feeding, coat or fleece condition, qualitative behaviour assessment), but further research is required. © 2019 by the authors.

Hence, it is in the interest of livestock farmers to have information on approaching calving events to ensure a sound birth, health and welfare of the dairy cow and calf for profitable and sustainable milk production. Changes in the ingestive behavior of dairy cows due to the onset of calving have been revealed in several studies. Therefore, sensor data of these behaviors may be useful for automated prediction of calving time. The current study used sensor data of a novel monitoring device for ingestive behavior (RumiWatch noseband sensor, Agroscope, Ettenhausen, Switzerland and Itin+Hoch GmbH, Liestal, Switzerland) of 35 dairy cows for development and validation of a predictive model for calving time. Sensor data obtained from calving events on three farms were used as one training dataset and two independent validation datasets to evaluate the predictive performance of a Naïve Bayes classifier model for calving prediction at 1 h before the start of calving. The model performance was evaluated on an hourly basis for 168 h prior to the start of calving. Combined sensor variables with highest predictive performance were ruminating chews, ruminating boluses, and eating chews (sensitivity = 0.82, specificity = 0.87, positive predictive value = 0.04) in Validation Dataset 1, and ruminating chews per bolus, ruminating chews per minute, eating chews, other activity time, other chews (sensitivity = 0.69, specificity = 0.86, positive predictive value = 0.03) in Validation Dataset 2. These results indicate, that the sensitivity and specificity of the predictive model were satisfying, but the positive predictive value was low and the amount of false positive alerts was considerably high. Although the developed model is therefore not suitable for application in practice, we found that particularly variables of rumination behavior have predictive value and should be taken into consideration for future research on calving detection models. The findings of this study demonstrate that an assessment limited to the terms of sensitivity and specificity may be misleading, as these variables may achieve high values and suggest adequate performance, while the model is not appropriate in the light of its expected use. © 2018 The Authors","Animal monitoring; Naïve Bayes classifier; Precision dairy farming; RumiWatch; Transition cow","Agriculture; Classification (of information); Bayes Classifier; Dairy farming; Positive predictive values; Predictive performance; RumiWatch; Sensitivity and specificity; Sensor measurements; Transition cow; Dairies; cattle; dairy farming; measurement method; milk production; model; model validation; monitoring system; sensor; Switzerland; Animalia"

Economic advantages for dairy producers associated with increased animal welfare are likely to come from either a premium paid for the milk or increased productivity. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the associations between measures of herd productivity and farm profitability and animal-, management-, and resource-based indicators of cow welfare and comfort. The cow welfare measures were collected during a cow comfort assessment conducted on 130 Canadian freestall dairy farms, including 20 using an automatic milking system. Herd productivity and farm profitability measures were retrieved or calculated from data collected by the regional dairy herd improvement programs, and included milk production and quality, longevity, and economic margins over replacement costs. Univariable and multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the associations between welfare indicators and productivity and profitability measures. Increased yearly corrected milk production was associated with reduced prevalence of cows with knee lesions [β = 7.40; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6, 12.2], dirty flanks (β = 26.9; 95% CI: 7.4, 46.5), and lameness (β = 11.7; 95% CI: 3.3, 20.1). The farms' economic margin per cow, calculated over replacement costs, was associated with the within farm average lying time standard deviation (β = −7.2; 95% CI: −12.7, −1.7), percent of stalls with dry bedding (β = 6.4; 95% CI: 1.4, 11.4), and prevalence of cows with knee lesions (β = −5.1; 95% CI: −8.9, −1.3). Some of the relationships found were complex, including several interactions between the animal-, management-, and resource-based measures. Overall, the results suggest that improved cow comfort and welfare on freestall farms is associated with increased herd productivity and profitability, when the latest is calculated by the margins over the replacement costs. © 2019 American Dairy Science Association","productivity; profitability; welfare indicator; well-being","agricultural land; Alberta; animal; animal housing; animal welfare; bovine; dairying; economics; female; Ontario; physiology; procedures; Quebec; Alberta; Animal Welfare; Animals; Cattle; Dairying; Farms; Female; Housing, Animal; Ontario; Quebec"

Early indicators of medical problems, which use sensors to alert cattle farmers early concerning individual animals that need special care, are proliferating. Wearable technologies dominate the market. In less-value-per-animal systems like sheep, goat, pig, poultry, and fish, one sensor, like a camera or robot per herd/flock/school, rather than one sensor per animal, will become common. PLF sensors generate huge amounts of data, and many actors benefit from PLF data. No standards currently exist for sharing sensor-generated data, limiting the use of commercial sensors.

On-farm welfare assessment, however, usually relies on both individual and group measures. As regards the latter, individual animals are not identified (eg incidence of stereotypic behaviour in a pen) or features of the whole group (eg score obtained from qualitative behaviour assessment) are used. This raises the question whether our current approaches to on-farm assessment sufficiently consider the individual nature of animal welfare. Measures assessed at the group level bear the disadvantage that distribution across group members may be skewed and the most affected individuals are not necessarily identified. However, the importance of knowing about the welfare state of individual animals depends on the purpose of the assessment. If the primary aim is farm assurance, the individual animal is of lesser importance, but non-compliance with thresholds at herd/farm level or comparison with peer farms may induce change. Using individual measures in a sample of animals means that animals not sampled but requiring intervention, eg for treatment of lameness, would have to be identified subsequently. Measures truly taken at the group level make individual interventions difficult, but interventions implemented at the group level (eg reducing stocking density) do not necessarily require information on the individual animal. Automatic detection of welfare-relevant states has received increased attention and identifying individual animals with impaired welfare seems to be promising. Automated early detection of problems may also reduce the ethical dilemma that traditional assessments at the end of the production cycle, eg in broiler chickens, may identify welfare impairments but not directly benefit the affected animals. Reflection on individual and group measures and their consequences for animal welfare may help in interpreting the outcomes of the assessments and stimulate future developments in the field. © 2019 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare The Old School, Brewhouse Hill, Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire AL4 8AN, UK.","Animal welfare; Group measures; Individual measures; On-farm assessment; Purpose; Welfare improvement","adult; agricultural land; animal experiment; animal tissue; animal welfare; article; attention; behavior assessment; broiler; female; herd; incidence; male; nonhuman; outcome assessment; stereotypy; stocking density"

Worldwide, humankind keeps an enormous number of domesticated birds (e.g. chickens) for their eggs and their meat, providing rich sources of low-fat protein. However, around the world, there have been growing concerns about the quality of life for the livestock in poultry farms; and increasingly vocal demands for improved standards of animal welfare. Recent advances in sensing technologies and machine learning allow the possibility of automatically assessing the health of some individual birds, and employing the lessons learned to improve the welfare for all birds. This task superficially appears to be easy, given the dramatic progress in recent years in classifying human behaviors, and given that human behaviors are presumably more complex. However, as we shall demonstrate, classifying chicken behaviors poses several unique challenges, chief among which is creating a generalizable 'dictionary' of behaviors from sparse and noisy data. In this work we introduce a novel time series dictionary learning algorithm that can robustly learn from weakly labeled data sources. © 2018 IEEE.","Animal Welfare; Chicken Behavior; Classification; Motif Discovery; Similarity Search","Agriculture; Behavioral research; Birds; Classification (of information); Machine learning; Time series; Animal welfare; Chicken Behavior; Dictionary learning algorithms; Human food chain; Motif discovery; Sensing technology; Similarity search; Time series classifications; Learning algorithms"

This cross-sectional study investigated possible effects of stockperson and farm related factors on cows´ behaviour towards humans in different test situations on a range of farm types including farms with automatic milking system. On 32 dairy farms, cows´ avoidance distances (AD), tolerance to tactile interactions (TTI), behavioural reactions during and after release from restraint (RB) and expressive behaviour by means of qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA) were recorded. Multiple regressions were calculated to analyse associations between the cows´ responses towards humans and factors of stockpersons´ attitudes, factors of human-animal contact and further herd and management characteristics. Positive attitudes towards cows were significantly associated with calmer cows in all test situations. Furthermore, different herd and management factors were related to individual variables of cows´ behaviour towards humans: for instance, the percentage of dehorned cows in the herd was associated with more fearful cows; the frequency of human-animal contact, manual feed provision, or selection for docility were associated with calmer cows. Explained variances were highest for the outcome variables AD and QBA. Directly or indirectly all factors remaining in the final models may be related to the amount and quality of human-animal contacts. Thus, the results suggest that on a broad range of different farm types a positive attitude and frequent human-animal contact can contribute to calmer cows in different interactions with humans in the barn. © 2018 Ebinghaus et al.

Fifty-four farms were visited once to collect facility measurements and observations, interview the dairy producer, and score cows for locomotion, hock lesions, and hygiene. Median number of AMS units/farm was 2 (interquartile range = 1; range = 1 to 8). Factors concerning labor were the most commonly cited reason by dairy producers for making the transition to the AMS; additional commonly cited factors were an improvement in lifestyle and human health. Number of cows fetched per AMS, or manually brought to the AMS if not milked voluntarily, was 4.7 ± 2.3 cows/AMS per day (8% of cows) for free traffic flow farms and 3.3 ± 1.8 cows/AMS per day (5% of cows) for guided traffic flow farms. Cow resting surface was significantly associated with prevalence of lameness and severe lameness. Farms with sand-bedded freestalls (17.2%) and bedded packs (17.4%) had significantly lower lameness prevalence (score ≥3 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = normal locomotion) than farms with mattress freestalls (30.5%), waterbeds (25.0%), and mattresses with access to pasture (22.6%). Farms with mattresses and access to pasture had similar lameness prevalence to farms with waterbeds, but were lower than farms with mattresses only. A somewhat similar result was found for severe lameness prevalence (score ≥4 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = normal locomotion); farms with sand-bedded freestalls (2.8%), bedded packs (0.0%), and mattress freestalls with access to pasture (1.5%) had significantly lower prevalence than farms with mattresses (7.1%) or waterbeds (10.8%). Severe hock lesion prevalence (score = 3 on a 1 to 3 scale, with 1 = normal, 3 = swelling) in herds with sand-bedded freestalls, waterbeds, and bedded packs were similar and significantly lower than the prevalence in mattress-based freestalls. Cows housed in sand-bedded freestalls had significantly lower prevalence of dirty cows (score = 3 or 3.5 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = clean) than those housed on mattresses and waterbeds, and had significantly lower prevalence of severely dirty cows (score = 4, 4.5 or 5 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = clean) than all other housing systems except waterbeds, which was similar. Manure removal system (manual, automatic, or slatted floor) was significantly associated with prevalence of severely dirty cows; farms with manual scraping had lower prevalence of severely dirty cows than farms where alley scraping was practiced automatically or slatted floors were used.

At 4 d of age, 112 calves had accelerometers attached to their hind leg and were housed in pens with ACFS. Calves were examined daily for signs of illness or injury. Of the 112 calves monitored, 18 were diagnosed with NCD; activities of calves with NCD were then compared with those of 18 healthy controls (calves that had no symptoms of NCD, other illnesses, or injury). Feeding (milk consumption and the number of rewarded and unrewarded visits to the feeder) and lying behavior during the 5 d leading up to calves displaying clinical signs of NCD were analyzed. Calves with NCD performed fewer unrewarded visits and consumed less milk than healthy calves during the 2- and 4-d periods before diagnosis with NCD, respectively. Calves with NCD tended to perform fewer lying bouts than healthy calves over the 5-d period before diagnosis with NCD. At 3 wk of age, a subset of 51 healthy calves were allocated to 1 of 5 treatment groups: (1) sham handling (SHAM, n = 10), (2) cautery disbudding (DB, n = 11), (3) administration of local anesthetic (LA) and DB (LA+DB, n = 11), 4) administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and DB (NSAID+DB, n = 9), and (5) administration of LA, NSAID and DB (LA+NSAID+DB, n = 10). Feeding and lying behavior were recorded continuously for 24 h pre- and postdisbudding. We found no effect of treatment on the number of rewarded or unrewarded visits to the feeder and milk volume consumed 24 h before administration of treatments. During the 24-h postdisbudding period, SHAM calves performed more unrewarded visits than DB, LA+DB, and NSAID+DB calves, but the number of unrewarded visits did not differ between SHAM and LA+NSAID+DB calves. During the first hour of the posttreatment period we noted a difference in lying times among treatments, with DB and NSAID+DB calves spending less time lying than SHAM calves and lying times being similar between SHAM, LA+DB, and LA+NSAID+DB calves. The ACFS and accelerometers have the potential to automatically gather valuable information regarding health status and pain in calves. Therefore, it may be advantageous to combine both of these measures (ACFS and accelerometers) when evaluating NCD on farm or pain in calves in future research. © 2018 American Dairy Science Association","automated measures; behavior; disbudding; feeding; welfare","local anesthetic agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; accelerometry; animal; animal behavior; bovine; cattle disease; diarrhea; local anesthesia; milk; procedures; surgery; veterinary medicine; Accelerometry; Anesthesia, Local; Anesthetics, Local; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Behavior, Animal; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Diarrhea; Milk"

Pain is often associated with common production diseases such as lameness and mastitis, as well as introduced to the animal through routine husbandry practices such as castration and tail docking. Farm animals are prey species which tend not to overtly express pain or weakness, making recognizing and evaluating pain incredibly difficult. Current methods of pain assessment do not provide information on what the animal is experiencing at that moment in time, only that its experience is having a long term negative impact on its behavior and biological functioning. Measures that provide reliable information about the animals’ affective state in that moment are urgently required; facial expression as a pain assessment tool has this ability. Automation of the detection and analysis of facial expression is currently in development, providing further incentive to use these methods in animal welfare assessment. © 2018 by the author.

The objectives of this review are to: 1) provide an update on performances reached by sensor systems to detect estrus and calving time; 2) discuss current economic issues related to connected devices for the management of cattle reproduction; 3) propose perspectives for these devices. The main physiological parameters monitored separately or in combination by connected devices are the cow activity, body temperature and rumination or eating behavior. The combination of several indicators in one sensor may maximize the performances of estrus and calving detection. An effort remains to be made for the prediction of calvings that will require human assistance (dystocia). The main reasons to invest in connected devices are to optimize herd reproductive performances and reduce labor on farm. The economic benefit was evaluated for estrus detection and depends on the initial herd performances, herd size, labor cost and price of the equipment. Major issues associated with the use of automated sensor systems are the weight of financial investment, the lack of economic analysis and limited skills of the users to manage associated technologies.

The Canadian dairy industry recently updated their Code of Practice for the care of dairy animals and created a mandatory on-farm animal care assessment (proAction Animal Care). Motivating dairy farmers to follow the recommendations of the Code of Practice and successfully meet the targets of the on-farm assessment can be enhanced by financial gain associated with improved animal welfare. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the association between meeting or not meeting several criteria from an on-farm animal welfare assessment and the farms' productivity and profitability indicators. Data from 130 freestall farms (20 using automatic milking systems) were used to calculate the results of the animal care assessment. Productivity and profitability indicators, including milk production, somatic cell count, reproduction, and longevity, were retrieved from the regional dairy herd improvement association databases. Economic margins over replacement costs were also calculated. Univariable and multivariable linear regression models were used to evaluate the associations between welfare and productivity and profitability indicators. The proportion of automatic milking system farms that met the proAction criterion for hock lesions was higher compared with parlor farms and lower for the neck lesion criterion. The proAction criterion for lameness prevalence was significantly associated with average corrected milk production per year. Average days in milk (DIM) at first breeding acted as an effect modifier for this association, resulting in a steeper increase of milk production in farms that met the criterion with increasing average DIM at first breeding. The reproduction and longevity indicators studied were not significantly associated with meeting or not meeting the proAction criteria investigated in this study. Meeting the proAction lameness prevalence parameter was associated with an increased profitability margin per cow over replacement cost by $236 compared with farms that did not. These results suggest that associations are present between meeting the lameness prevalence benchmark of the Animal Care proAction Initiative and freestall farms' productivity and profitability. Overall, meeting the animal-based criteria evaluated in this study was not detrimental to freestall farms' productivity and profitability. © 2018 American Dairy Science Association","animal welfare assessment; cow comfort; farm productivity; farm profitability","agricultural land; animal; animal lameness; animal welfare; bovine; Canada; cattle disease; cell count; cost; dairying; economics; female; gait; metabolism; milk; reproduction; veterinary; Animal Welfare; Animals; Canada; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Cell Count; Costs and Cost Analysis; Dairying; Farms; Female; Gait; Lameness, Animal; Milk; Reproduction"

Then, all the resulting subgroups have been converted in a network and a cluster-graph analysis has been applied in order to find herd-descriptive subgraphs. The results of the study have the potential impact of improving herd characterisation and lending support to cow monitoring and management.

However, in order to construct a tool which will properly recognize abnormalities in pigs' growth a precise description of the growth process should be used. In this study we proposed a new model of pig growth accounting for daily fluctuations in BW. Body weight measurements of 1710 pigs (865 gilts and 843 barrows) originating from five consecutive batches from a Danish commercial farm were collected. Pigs were inserted into a large pen (maximum capacity=400) between November 2014 and September 2015. On average, each pig was observed for 42 days and weighed 3.6 times a day when passing from the resting to feeding area. Altogether, 243,160 BW measurements were recorded. A multilevel model of pig growth was constructed and fitted to available data. The BW of pigs was modeled as a quadratic function of time. A diurnal pattern was incorporated into the model by a cosine wave with known length (24 h). The model included pig effect which was defined as a random autoregressive process with exponential correlation. Variance of within-pigs error was assumed to increase with time. Because only five batches were observed, it was not possible to obtain the random effect for batch. However, in order to account for the batch effect the model included interactions between batch and fixed parameters: intercept, time, square value of time and cosine wave. The gender effect was not significant and was removed from the final model. For all batches, morning and afternoon peaks in the frequency of visits to the feeding area could be distinguished. According to results, pigs were lighter in the morning and heavier in the evening (minimum BW was reached around 1000 h and maximum around 2200 h). However, the exact time of obtaining maximum and minimum BW during the day differed between batches. Pigs had access to natural light and, therefore, existing differences could be explained by varying daylight level during observations periods. Because the diurnal amplitude for pig growth varied between batches from 0.9 to 1.4 kg, BW monitoring tools based on frequent measurements should account for diurnal variation in BW of pigs. This proposed description of growth will be built into a monitoring tool (a dynamic linear model) and applied to farm data in future studies. © The Animal Consortium 2017 This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution licence (.","automatic growth monitoring; BW; diurnal pattern; pigs","animal; animal husbandry; biological model; body weight; female; growth, development and aging; male; pig; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Body Weight; Female; Male; Models, Biological; Swine"

To better understand how US dairy producers are operating these systems, this study investigated characteristics of barn design, environment, and management practices on 38 farms in the Upper Midwest of the United States via a questionnaire and on-farm measurements. Farms using automated feeders ranged in size from 7 to 300 calves on site. Natural ventilation was used on 50% of the farms, followed by barns with mechanical ventilation (39.5%), tunnel ventilation (7.9%), or outdoor facilities (sheltered plastic domes; 2.6%). Calves were kept in groups of 17.6 ± 9.8 animals (range: 5.9 to 60.5) with an average space allowance of 4.6 ± 2.0 m2/animal (range: 1.6 to 11.9). Calves on these farms received 3.7 ± 0.75 L (range: 2 to 6) of colostrum, but 22% of the tested calves had serum total protein values lower than 5.0 g/dL. Calves had an initial daily allowance of 5.4 ± 2.1 L (range: 3 to 15 L) of milk or milk replacer, rising to a peak amount of 8.3 ± 2.0 L (range: 5 to 15 L) over 18 ± 11.4 d (range: 0 to 44 d). Milk replacer was fed to calves on 68.4% of the farms compared with whole milk supplemented with nutrient balancer on 23.7% and whole milk alone on 7.9% of the farms. Calves were completely weaned at 56.8 ± 9.0 d of age (range: 40 to 85.5) and 52.1 ± 7.5 d (range: 40 to 79) since introduction into the group pen with the feeder. Notably, bacterial contamination of milk was common; the median coliform count was 10,430 cfu/mL (interquartile range: 233,111; range: 45 to 28,517,000) and standard plate count was 2,566,867 cfu/mL (interquartile range: 15,860,194; range 6,668 to 82,825,000) for samples collected from the feeder tube end (or feeder hose). Some areas of deficiency might be of concern as they might be influencing the success of using automated calf feeding systems. In particular, a better understanding of the dynamics of pathogen load is needed in both the group pen area and in the automated feeder unit itself, as these reservoirs represent significant risk to calf health and welfare. © 2017 American Dairy Science Association","automated calf feeder; calf management","animal; animal housing; bovine; dairying; female; Iowa; microbiology; milk; Minnesota; procedures; statistics and numerical data; Wisconsin; Animals; Cattle; Dairying; Female; Housing, Animal; Iowa; Milk; Minnesota; Wisconsin"

It starts with the challenge of defining and measuring animal welfare. Subsequently, the demand for farm animal welfare is evaluated from both the citizens' perspective and the consumers' perspective. The much-cited preference gap in between these perspectives constitutes a dilemma for the governance of animal welfare. Literature on the supply of farm animal welfare discusses the implications of enhancing farm animal welfare for production cost. The linkages between farm structure, farm technology, and animal welfare are discussed, and the frequently voiced hypothesis that smaller and more traditional farms automatically imply higher farm animal welfare levels is rejected. We examine the central challenge to the governance of farm animal welfare: its effects on competitiveness and trade. We also discuss objectives, governance instruments, the interplay of different policy instruments, and how to combine them for an effective and efficient strategy for farm animal welfare. © 2017 by Annual Reviews.

The objectives of the current study were to (1) determine the ability of the IceTag 3D pedometer to accurately measure step data for cows in tie-stalls, and (2) determine whether the leg on which the pedometer is mounted impacts step data. Twenty randomly selected Holstein dairy cows were equipped with pedometers on each rear leg and recorded for 6 h over three 2-h periods. Two observers were trained to measure step activity and the total number of steps per minute were measured. Hourly averages for right and left leg data were analyzed separately using a multivariate mixed model to determine the correlation between pedometer and video step data as well as the correlation between left and right leg step data. The analysis of the video versus pedometer data yielded a high overall correlation for both the left (r = 0.93) and right (r = 0.95) legs. Additionally, there was good correlation between the left and right leg step data (r = 0.80). These results indicate that the IceTag 3D pedometers were accurate for calculating step activity in tie-stall housed dairy cows and can be mounted on either leg of a cow. This study confirms that these pedometers could be a useful automated tool in both a research and commercial setting to better address welfare issues in dairy cows housed in tie-stalls. © 2017 by the authors.

In general, footpad lesions are linked to poor environmental conditions. Ulcers that arise from advanced lesions can negatively affect the gait of the birds, with effects on the animal welfare, including, in the worst cases, inability to reach the feed or water. In this study, the degree of footpad dermatitis and lameness was manually scored on 4 broiler farms across Europe, as part of an EU-wide welfare assessment program. The welfare of the chickens was assessed 3 times per production cycle (at wk 3, 4, and 5), scoring footpad dermatitis, lameness, and litter quality. In the same broiler farms, variables such as air temperature and relative humidity were automatically measured over the same period. These variables were combined into a widely accepted thermal comfort index and associated to upper and lower thresholds, which made it possible to quantify the percentage of time the birds spent out of the thermal comfort zone (POOC). The data was analyzed by combining data from the welfare assessments with environmental data collected by the automated monitoring systems. Considering the comparison between POOC classes, the highest probabilities of footpad dermatitis and lameness were obtained when POOC values exceeded the 70% threshold. Therefore, the analysis showed that footpad dermatitis and lameness were more frequent when the flock was exposed to poor environmental conditions for prolonged periods (P < 0.001). Since environmental conditions can be continuously measured, and the risk factor for footpad dermatitis and lameness increases with poor environmental conditions, there is the possibility to develop a detection and control system of severe lesions. © 2017 American Society of Animal Science.

Automated trajectory tracking based on head/tail locations is supposed to be extremely helpful for the realization of pig behavior recognition, especially for group housed pigs in the commercial pig facility. The methods of trajectory tracking for group housed pigs based on head/tail location were described in this paper. The video of group housed nurseries was taken in a commercial pig breeding farm of Hubei Jinlin Original Breeding Swine Co. Ltd. on January 12th, 2016. A high resolution camera (Woshida CL03) was used to record 15 min video. Afterwards, image frames were extracted from the original video in a one-second time interval. Image frames were processed in a computer (configured with IntelCore i7-4790 CPU (central processing unit), 3.6 GHz, 8 G memory) with MATLAB software platform. The image processing for each image frame included 4 steps: background removal, pigs division, head/tail identification and trajectory tracking modification. The background removal was based on the RGB (red, green, blue) color space, from which a vector of RGB mean values of the pig's body was calculated. If the Euclidean distance between the RGB values of one pixel and the RGB mean values vector was less than a small threshold of 100, the pixel was involved in a pig body area and set as 1. Otherwise, it was outside any pig body area and set as 0. When all pixels of the image frame were scanned and calculated by this method, a binary image was acquired. The white area referred to pig's body area, while the black area referred to the background. After that, the morphology erosion and expansion were utilized before the watershed segmentation algorithm to improve the dividing effect for the pigs with adhesion. Pigs division was implemented on the binary images with the improved watershed segmentation algorithm. To discriminate each pig in each image frame, a video tracking and marking method was necessary to be implemented in the video. After being manually marked with the identify number in the first frame, each pig had a unique number and was labelled automatically throughout the video. Abstracting image frames from the video with a very short time interval (1 s), the distance of 2 centroids of the identical pig between 2 continuous image frames would be sufficiently small. Therefore, the video tracking was to find the pig with the closest distance in the next image frame and mark it with the same identify number of the current pig until all the pigs were marked. After each pig was marked throughout the video, using the head/tail location as the coordinates of the pig, the trajectory of each pig in herd could be tracked by the trajectory calculation. Extracting the outline of each pig in frames, the head and the tail outlines were divided from the whole outline, after a sixth of whole outline distance was moved along the outline in 2 opposite directions from the 2 intersection points of the outline and short axis of the minimum bounding rectangle. After the head/tail outline curve was gained from each pig outline, 2 recognition algorithms, the analogous Hough clustering recognition algorithm and the roundness recognition algorithm, were employed to identify the head/tail of each pig. Thus the location of the pig's head/tail could be spotted by locating the centroid of the heat/tail curve. Then the trajectory tracking of the pigs was calculated based on the location of head/tail, and corrected by the motion trends of pigs. Experiment showed that the background was successfully removed from each image frame using the Euclidean distance of RGB values between the pixels and the mean value vector. The improved watershed segmentation algorithm has been verified as an effective tool to divide the pigs with adhesion. The identify number of each pig was tracked from the first frame to the end. The average recognition rate of analogous Hough clustering algorithm was 71.79% for the identification of pig's heads/tails, while the roundness algorithm was 79.67%, which was less sensitive to the distortion of head outline curve. If not including the pigs outside the camera range, the recognition rates would be up to 75% and 85.7% respectively. The roundness algorithm shows an obvious advantage in comparison. The modified trajectory of each pig shows a high agreement with the manually labelled trajectory. More understanding for pigs' behaviors can be acquired from the trajectory of head/tail locations. This trajectory tracking method provides a good reference for further research of behavior recognition. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Under this new scenario, farmers need to be provided with tools to manage their farm more efficiently. Currently the health status of small ruminants is monitored by farmers using mostly visual inspection however this become ineffective for larger stock numbers. This piece of work presents a new machine learning algorithm based on autoregressive hidden Markov model to analyse triaxial accelerometer data to classify sheep behavioural patterns. The algorithm creates a model of animal’s activity directly from raw data from the sensors and was specifically design for running on embedded devices. This approach allows the model, when used on the initial healthy animal, to be automatically tuned for each individual which subsequently provides a normal reference for abnormal detection. Finally, a set of experiments were performed where a sheep was fitted with the collar prototype over two days. The animal under study was maintained in a shed with two other sheep. The result of this experiment shows that algorithm achieved an average of 93.40±0.09% accuracy when determining the animals’ activities using only the accelerometer data which is comparable to more computer expensive classifying techniques. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

In addition to being labor intensive and time consuming, it is difficult for the farm owners to find consistent labor to fill these jobs. To address these problems, researchers at the Georgia Tech Research Institute and the University of Georgia developed and tested a mobile robot system for operation in confined poultry grow out houses. A prototype system was built for testing and validation. The system uses a commercially available chassis, with custom developed software to handle localization, navigation, and interaction with the animals. These routines were developed to allow the robot to navigate in and among a flock of live chickens and to carry out inspection and some utility tasks. There are several potential applications related to poultry house management that a capable mobile robot system would be able to carry out. Some examples of these such as automated picking of floor eggs and image analysis for chicken and house equipment monitoring were developed and demonstrated in a laboratory environment. The robot autonomy and navigation was field tested and completed over 20 hours of fully autonomous operation in a test chicken house at facilities located at the University of Georgia. In addition, the same robot was demonstrated in a commercial house, navigating autonomously for approximately 2 hours. The research team studied the ability of the robot to successfully navigate the house while ensuring there was no negative impact on the animal welfare. These validation tests successfully proved that the prototype system can achieve the desired goal of navigating in a chicken house environment.","Animal robot interaction; Automated egg removal; Poultry house management; Robotics","Animals; Houses; Mobile robots; Navigation; Robotics; Veterinary medicine; Animal-robot interaction; Autonomous operations; Equipment monitoring; Laboratory environment; Mobile robot systems; Poultry house; Research institutes; University of Georgia; Robots"

This usually occurs after a long period of time during which the animal endures suffering from pain caused by the hoof lesion, seeing as cows will try to hide signs of disease (in this case: an obvious limp) as long as possible. This study evaluated automatically recorded performance and behaviour parameters as possible risk factors for lameness that could be used for an automatic lameness alert in order to detect lameness cases earlier. The study herd consisted out of 60 Simmental cattle housed in a free stall barn. The herd was observed continuously from April 2014 to April 2015 using different sensors to measure performance (milk yield, live weight, feed intake) and behaviour (feeding behaviour, standing, lying and activity index) related parameters, adding up to a total of 27 variables. During the data collection period the whole herd was locomotion scored weekly according to Sprecher et al. (1997) (1-5, 1 = healthy, 5 = severely lame) in order to assess lameness in every individual. After dividing the data into a training and a test dataset, the training set was fitted into a regularized regression method (Elastic Net) including relevant interaction terms. The preliminary model fitted on the training dataset had an AUC (Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) of 0.95 with a sensitivity of 0.95 (95 %-confidence interval: 0.92-0.97) and a specificity of 0.83 (95 %-confidence interval: 0.79-0.86) and the same model fitted on the training data resulted in an AUC of 0.84 with a sensitivity of 1.00 (95 %-confidence interval: 0.19-1.00) and a specificity of 0.80 (95 %- confidence interval: 0.71-0.87).

The expectation is that a robot also can execute such tasks and could do it 24 hours 7 days a week if needed. A concept of a multi-layer monitoring support system has been designed to assist the poultry farmer. The multi-layer support system consists of a static system for flock observation (existing PLF technology), and robot(s) for in-between bird observation of health and behaviour and for performing routine daily tasks. Poultry farmers, researchers and companies have been consulted in two workshops to identify the needs and wishes for such a system. The results of the consultations could be grouped into the following six main categories: 1) bird monitoring (e.g. behaviour, health); 2) data sharing (e.g. production, health); 3) eggs (e.g. selection, collection of floor eggs); 4) vaccination (e.g. treatment, evaluation); 5) quality control (e.g. manure consistency, litter); and 6) selection of birds (e.g. collecting dead birds, identifying non-productive birds). The overall results showed that there is a market demand of poultry farmers for such a multi-level monitoring system. A first economic survey showed that broiler farmers were willing to invest €0.58 per bird place with an desired payback time of 2 years and other poultry farmers were willing to invest €1.04 per bird place with a desired payback time of 4 years. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

New technological innovations potentially adaptable to commercial poultry are appearing, although their practical implementation is still being defined. In this paper, we review the latest technological developments with potential to be applied to poultry welfare, especially for broiler chickens and laying hens. Some of the examples that are presented and discussed include the following: sensors for farm environmental monitoring, movement, or physiological parameters; imaging technologies such as optical flow to detect gait problems and feather pecking; infrared technologies to evaluate birds’ thermoregulatory features and metabolism changes, that may be indicative of welfare, health and management problems.

However, the adoption of agricultural technology is not homogenous, and diversity in integration leads to a diversity of outcomes and impacts. In this study, we examine the adoption of automated milking systems (AMS) in small and midsize dairy farms in the US Midwest, the Netherlands, and Denmark. In contrast to technological determinism, we find significant variation amongst adopters in the implementation of AMS and corresponding variation in outcomes. Adopters have significant discretion in determining the use of AMS, which leads to a diversity of possible outcomes for family and non-family labor, human–cow relationships, animal welfare, the environment, and financial resiliency. Adoption and implementation are shaped by both structural factors, such as debt load and labor market variation, and by farmers’ individual personality traits and values, such as a willingness (or not) to release control to technology. Rather than uniform adoption and impacts of technology, we highlight the importance of context, the co-constitution of technology and users, and the diversity of technology adoption and its associated impacts. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Animal studies; Animal welfare; Dairy farming; Environment; Labor; Technology","Animalia"

This paper aims to create an understanding of ethics that is helpful in debating technological innovation by studying such a co-evolution process in detail: the development and adoption of the milking robot. Over the last decade an increasing number of milking robots, or automatic milking systems (AMS), has been adopted, especially in the Netherlands and a few other Western European countries. The appraisal of this new technology in ethical terms has appeared to be a complicated matter. Compared to using a conventional milking parlor, the use of an AMS entails in several respects a different practice of dairy farming, the ethical implications and evaluation of which are not self-evident but are themselves part of a dynamic process. It has become clear that with its use, the entire practice of dairy farming has been reorganized around this new device. With a robot, cows must voluntarily present themselves to be milked, whereby an ethical norm of (individual) freedom for cows can be seen to emerge together with this new technology. But adopting a robot also implies changes in what is considered to be a good farmer and an appropriate relation between farmer and cow. Through interviews, attending “farmers’ network” meetings in the Netherlands, and studying professional literature and dedicated dairy farming web forums, this paper traces the way that ethical concerns are a dynamic part of this process of rearranging a variety of elements of the practice of dairy farming. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Animal welfare; Automatic milking systems (AMS); Co-evolution of ethics and technology; Dairy farming; Human animal relations; Labor quality; Milking robots; Technology assessment",

In this paper, we present an overview of some of the most important recent changes in the dairy industry that affect health and welfare of dairy cows, as well as the science associated with these changes. Additionally, knowledge gaps are identified where research is needed to guide the dairy industry through changes that are occurring now or that we expect will occur in the future. The number of farms has decreased considerably, whereas herd size has increased. As a result, an increasing number of dairy farms depend on hired (nonfamily) labor. Regular professional communication and establishment of farm-specific protocols are essential to minimize human errors and ensure consistency of practices. Average milk production per cow has increased, partly because of improvements in nutrition and management but also because of genetic selection for milk production. Adoption of new technologies (e.g., automated calf feeders, cow activity monitors, and automated milking systems) is accelerating. However, utilization of the data and action lists that these systems generate for health and welfare of livestock is still largely unrealized, and more training of dairy farmers, their employees, and their advisors is necessary. Concurrently, to remain competitive and to preserve their social license to operate, farmers are increasingly required to adopt increased standards for food safety and biosecurity, become less reliant on the use of antimicrobials and hormones, and provide assurances regarding animal welfare. Partly because of increasing herd size but also in response to animal welfare regulations in some countries, the proportion of dairy herds housed in tiestalls has decreased considerably. Although in some countries access to pasture is regulated, in countries that traditionally practiced seasonal grazing, fewer farmers let their dairy cows graze in the summer. The proportion of organic dairy farms has increased globally and, given the pressure to decrease the use of antimicrobials and hormones, conventional farms may be able to learn from well-managed organic farms. The possibilities of using milk for disease diagnostics and monitoring are considerable, and dairy herd improvement associations will continue to expand the number of tests offered to diagnose diseases and pregnancy. Genetic and genomic selection for increased resistance to disease offers substantial potential but requires collection of additional phenotypic data. There is every expectation that changes in the dairy industry will be further accentuated and additional novel technologies and different management practices will be adopted in the future. © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.","Antimicrobials; Automated calf feeder; Automated milking system; Biosecurity; Herd size","antiinfective agent; hormone; animal; animal welfare; antibiotic resistance; bovine; Cattle Diseases; dairying; economics; herbivory; milk; organic farming; procedures; season; Animal Welfare; Animals; Anti-Infective Agents; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Dairying; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Herbivory; Hormones; Milk; Organic Agriculture; Seasons"

The objective of this study was to use electronic monitoring systems to determine the effect of feed delivery frequency on the behavioural patterns and productivity of lactating dairy cows. Ninety three lactating cows were subjected to each of 2 treatments. Feeding treatments consisted of 2 different frequencies (6×/d and 11×/d) replicated in 2 different 7 d periods. Lying behaviour of 8 cows randomly selected was electronically monitored, whereas video recording was used to quantify the feeding time of all cows. All individual-cow milking-related data were automatically collected. Frequency of feed delivery had no effect on daily feeding time, lying time and the lying bouts, but high feed delivery frequency did affect the distribution of the length of the lying bouts throughout the day, decreasing the number of bouts that lasted from 150 to 200 min (P < 0.01), and increasing the number of bouts that lasted from 100 to 150 min (P < 0.05). Feeding frequency affected the lying time (P < 0.05) and feeding time (P < 0.001) around the provision of fresh feed. Cows fed 6×/d tended to have a higher milk yield than those fed 11×/d, whereas dry matter intake and utilization of the automatic milking system did not vary by treatment. Based on these results, high feed frequency can be beneficial for even distribution of feeding time through the day, but very high feeding frequencies may disturb the lying behaviour (length of lying bouts) of cows.","Automated monitoring systems; Automatic feeding system; Behaviour; Dairy cow; Feeding frequency","Agriculture; Dairies; Monitoring; Video recording; Automated monitoring systems; Automatic feeding systems; Behaviour; Dairy cow; Feeding frequency; Feeding"

The present study investigated the effect of providing a small feed reward as an incentive at milking on the premilking voluntary waiting time of cows milked on a prototype robotic rotary in an Australian pasture-based dairy. The 2 treatments were ""feed on"" (concentrate offered at milking) and ""feed off"" (no concentrate offered at milking), with data from a single herd of 168 lactating dairy cows collected over 16. d. A survival analysis with time-varying covariates was used to model the voluntary waiting times of cows in the premilking yard. The median time cows spent waiting before milking was 129. min and after 4. h just over 70% of the cows had exited the yard (volunteered for milking). When feed was provided, cows were faster to exit the premilking yard (shorter time spent waiting) and waited just over half the time (0.53×) they did during the ""feed off"" treatment. Heifers exited the premilking yard more rapidly than cows in later lactations, with older cows spending at least 1.40 times longer in the yard before milking. Average daily milk yield along with stage of lactation and fetching cows from the paddock also influenced cow traffic in the premilking yard. As the number of cows in the premilking yard increased, voluntary waiting time also increased. At a queue length of 20 or more cows, the negative effect on waiting time of an additional cow entering the yard was less than that when fewer than 20 cows were present. Results demonstrated that feeding a small reward on the robotic rotary platform can reduce the time cows spend in the premilking yard, leading to a potential reduction in the risk of congestion at the dairy, particularly during times of high demand. Minimizing congestion will likely benefit multiple aspects of the voluntary milking operation, including a potential improvement in robot utilization, a reduction in unnecessary time spent off pasture by cows in the milking herd, promoting cow welfare through reducing the risk of lameness, and enhancing productivity. Targeting strategies to minimize queue length to less than the threshold length, which in this study was 20 cows, could result in reduced time spent in the premilking yard. © 2014 American Dairy Science Association.","Automatic milking; Feed incentive; Robotic rotary; Waiting time","animal; Australia; bovine; chemistry; dairying; female; lactation; milk; procedures; time; Animals; Australia; Cattle; Dairying; Female; Lactation; Milk; Time Factors"

Welfare problems vary with the conditions in which animals are maintained. The objectives were to highlight major welfare problems for dairy cows on farms in France, and find out how farm characteristics (housing and milking systems, breed) could impact specific welfare aspects on these farms. We conducted a cross-sectional survey on 131 French dairy farms. We used the Welfare Quality® protocol, which addresses all aspects of welfare, and yields scores for principles and criteria that represent how well farms meet welfare requirements (from 0 for a very adverse situation to 100 for an excellent one). We used descriptive statistics to highlight low welfare scores, and variance analyses to compare farms. Most farms were found 'Acceptable' according to the Welfare Quality® classification. Principles scores for Health, Feeding and Behaviour ranged from 33 to 39. The median score for eight of the welfare criteria was below 50 ('Pain', 'Integument alterations', 'Diseases', 'Comfort around resting', 'Social behaviours', 'Human-animal relationship', 'Positive emotional state', 'Hunger'), while the median score was above 50 for the four other criteria ('Thirst', 'Lameness', 'Expression of other behaviours', 'Ease of movement'). The scores varied widely between farms, within and between systems. Farms with cubicles obtained lower scores for 'Comfort around resting', 'Injuries'; farms with Holstein cows obtained lower scores for 'Hunger'; farms using an automatic milking system obtained lower scores for 'Expression of other behaviours' and 'Diseases' in Holstein herds. This survey yields information on bottlenecks in dairy cow welfare with all dimensions of welfare considered together. The results can be used by stakeholders to prioritise corrective actions in welfare plans, focusing either on the whole population of farms or on farms with characteristics that are at high risk for specific welfare problems. © 2014 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare","Animal welfare; Dairy cows; Farm characteristics; Risks factors; Welfare criteria; Welfare plan","animal behavior; animal care; animal food; animal health; animal housing; animal welfare; animal wellbeing; Article; behavior assessment; breed difference; cattle disease; clinical observation; cross-sectional study; dairy cattle; dairying; farming system; France; Holstein cattle; human; human-animal bond; hunger; nonhuman; social interaction; thirst; total quality management"

This study explored data from an automatic milking system (AMS) to model on-farm gait scoring from a commercial farm. A total of 88 cows were gait scored once per week, for 2 5-wk periods. Eighty variables retrieved from AMS were summarized week-wise and used to predict 2 defined classes: nonlame and clinically lame cows. Variables were represented with 2 transformations of the week summarized variables, using 2-wk data blocks before gait scoring, totaling 320 variables (2. ×. 2. ×. 80). The reference gait scoring error was estimated in the first week of the study and was, on average, 15%. Two partial least squares discriminant analysis models were fitted to parity 1 and parity 2 groups, respectively, to assign the lameness class according to the predicted probability of being lame (score 3 or 4/4) or not lame (score 1/4). Both models achieved sensitivity and specificity values around 80%, both in calibration and cross-validation. At the optimum values in the receiver operating characteristic curve, the false-positive rate was 28% in the parity 1 model, whereas in the parity 2 model it was about half (16%), which makes it more suitable for practical application; the model error rates were, 23 and 19%, respectively. Based on data registered automatically from one AMS farm, we were able to discriminate nonlame and lame cows, where partial least squares discriminant analysis achieved similar performance to the reference method. © 2014 American Dairy Science Association.","Animal welfare; Lameness detection in automatic milking system; Partial least squares discriminant analysis; Pattern recognition","Animalia; animal; animal behavior; automation; bovine; Cattle Diseases; dairying; discriminant analysis; female; gait; lactation; Lameness, Animal; metabolism; milk; parity; pathophysiology; physiologic monitoring; physiology; pregnancy; regression analysis; sensitivity and specificity; veterinary; Animals; Automation; Behavior, Animal; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Dairying; Discriminant Analysis; Female; Gait; Lactation; Lameness, Animal; Least-Squares Analysis; Milk; Monitoring, Physiologic; Parity; Pregnancy; Sensitivity and Specificity"

Because robotic milking involves the replacement of 'conventional' twice-a-day milking managed by people with a system that supposedly allows cows the freedom to be milked automatically whenever they choose, some claim robotic milking has health and welfare benefits for cows, increases productivity, and has lifestyle advantages for dairy farmers. This paper examines how established ethical relations on dairy farms are unsettled by the intervention of a radically different technology such as AMS. The renegotiation of ethical relationships is thus an important dimension of how the actors involved are re-assembled around a new technology. The paper draws on in-depth research on UK dairy farms comparing those using conventional milking technologies with those using AMS. We explore the situated ethical relations that are negotiated in practice, focusing on the contingent and complex nature of human-animal-technology interactions. We show that ethical relations are situated and emergent, and that as the identities, roles, and subjectivities of humans and animals are unsettled through the intervention of a new technology, the ethical relations also shift. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Animal studies; Dairy farming; Robotic milking; Situated ethics; Technology; UK",

Lameness in dairy cows is highly prevalent and painful. These impacts potentially affect not only animal welfare, but also farm economies. Three independent observational studies were carried out to assess the impact of lameness on the behaviour of zero grazed high yielding Holstein cows managed in an AMS. The aim of the first study was to examine the impact of lameness on rumination time, the second study investigated differences between lame and sound dairy cows in total eating time and the third study assessed the impact of lameness on milking behaviour (frequency and time of visits to the AMS). In the first study data from 150 cows were used to analyse rumination (collected using rumination collars) for the 48. h following locomotion scoring. A multilevel linear regression demonstrated that lameness had a small but significant negative association (coefficient: -7.88 (SE: 3.93)) with rumination. In the second study the behaviour of eleven matched lame and sound pairs of cows at the feed face was analysed for 24. h after locomotion scoring. Each feeding behaviour variable (total duration time, frequency of feeding bouts and length of bouts) was analysed using individual single level regression models. There was a significant negative association between total feeding time and lameness (coefficient: -73.65 (SE: 25.47)) and the frequency of feeding bouts and lameness (-9.93 (2.49)). Finally, the third observational study used 38 matched pairs of lame and sound cows. Data on the number and timings of visits to the AMS were collected for 24. h after each locomotion score and analysed using a binomial logistic regression model. There was a significant difference in AMS visits between groups; lame animals visiting the robot less frequently than sound cows (median difference 0.50 milking visits; T=256.0; N=25; p=0.01) and lame cows were 0.33 times less likely to visit the AMS between 24:01 and 06:00. Results from these studies reveal that lameness in an AMS affected feeding behaviour, rumination and AMS visits.

Lying behavior is often used as an indication of well-being in cattle and for evaluating the stall quality. The use of electronic data loggers to automate behavioral recording has become increasingly common. We tested the use of the Pedometer Plus tag (S.A.E. Afikim, Israel) for measuring the lying behavior of dairy cattle (n=18 lactating cows). Behavior was recorded for 11 days with the Pedometer Plus tag, from which the rest bout, bout duration and rest time were calculated. The lying behavior was simultaneously recorded using a HOBO Pendant G logger as a reference system to validate the Pedometer Plus tag. A linear regression analysis between the measurement methods showed that the recorded lying time (R2≥0.948) and the recorded number of lying bouts (R2≥0.718) were closely related, which was also confirmed by the comparison of the means (lying time, P=0.60; lying bouts, P=0.72). Despite the positive relationship, in some days, slope and intercept were statistically different from 1 and 0, respectively. The recordings of lying time and the number of lying bouts between the devices, for some cows, differed by more than 5%. The Pedometer Plus tag overestimates the number of lying bouts and underestimates the time that cows spend lying down with respect to HOBO pendant G logger recording. The different sampling, editing and filtering methods between devices may contribute to these discrepancies. This system will be advantageous for the reliable, 24h/d automated recording of individual animals in a herd. This system reduces the difficulty of performing continuous measurements of behavior for a large number of animals over a prolonged period of time.

Dairy farming is among the most dangerous occupations, with high rates of injury, illness, and employee turnover. Lower education levels, illiteracy, and limited language proficiency increase the possibility of injury or death associated with higher risk occupations such as dairy. Sustaining a healthy, productive workforce is a critical component of risk management; however, many owners and managers have not received formal training in employee management or occupational health and safety. Optimal dairy farming management should address milk production that is sustainable and responsible from the animal welfare, social, economic, and environmental perspectives. Each of these aspects is interdependent with each other and with a sustainable, healthy, productive workforce. Very few studies address the effectiveness of risk management in the dairy industry. Studies suggest that labor management practices are a potential competitive advantage for dairy farms, but the connection with efficiency, productivity, and profitability has not been clearly demonstrated. Transformational leadership has been associated with improved safety climate and reduced incidence of injury, whereas passive leadership styles have opposite effects. There is a need to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of safety-specific transformational leadership among dairy owners and managers. A systematic approach to risk management should address worker health and safety as an integral component of production, food safety, and animal welfare.

Data concerning the social networks of farm animal species and their ancestors are scarce but essential to establishing the importance of a natural social network for farmed animal species. Social Network Analysis (SNA) facilitates the characterization of social networking at group, subgroup and individual levels. SNA is currently used for modeling the social behavior and management of wild animals and social welfare of zoo animals. It has been recognized for use with farm animals but has yet to be applied for management purposes. Currently, the main focus is on cattle, because in large groups (poultry), recording of individuals is expensive and the existence of social networks is uncertain due to on-farm restrictions. However, in many cases, a stable social network might be important to individual animal fitness, survival and welfare. For instance, when laying hens are not too densely housed, simple networks may be established. We describe here small social networks in horses, brown bears, laying hens and veal calves to illustrate the importance of measuring social networks among animals managed by humans. Emphasis is placed on the automatic measurement of identity, location, nearest neighbors and nearest neighbor distance for management purposes. It is concluded that social networks are important to the welfare of human-managed animal species and that welfare management based on automatic recordings will become available in the near future. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Animal management; Animal welfare; Approach-avoidance behavior; Bos taurus; Captive animals; Equus caballus; Gallus gallus domesticus; SNA; Social network analysis; Ursus arctos",

The increasing demand for animal products has made mass animal breeding more important than ever. Satisfying the needs of the market, farmers will have to use automatic tools to monitor the welfare and health of their animals since manual monitoring is expensive and time consuming. Literature has shown that water use of pigs relates to important variables such as inside temperature, food intake, food conversion, growth rate and health condition. So, water use might be an interesting indicator for automatic monitoring pigs' health or productivity status. Therefore, we tried to find a cheap and elegant way to monitor continuous water use in a group of pigs in a farm pen. This study comprised four groups of piglets, each group of ten animals in a pen. On average, in the beginning of experiments pigs had a weight of 27. kg and in the end they gained weight up to 40. kg. Using a water-meter for each pen, water use rate was measured and monitored minutely. The pig house was also equipped with Charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras. Each pen was monitored for 13. days using a camera which was installed above the pen to generate top-view images. There was a water outlet in the corner of each pen. Employing image processing algorithms, drink nipple visits were monitored automatically. Using data of a performed experiment comprising three weeks of data recordings, the relationship between water use and drink nipple visits was investigated. Results showed that by developing a data-based dynamic model of the visits to the drink nipple observed in videos, half-hourly water use could be estimated with an accuracy of 92%. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Drink nipple visits; Pig barn; Pig welfare monitoring; Transfer function modelling; Water use monitoring","Cameras; Experiments; Health; Image processing; Mammals; Animal products; Automatic monitoring; Automatic tools; Drink nipple visits; Food intake; Food production; Four-group; Function modelling; Health condition; Image processing algorithm; Inside temperature; Manual monitoring; Pig barn; Pig house; Water use; Water supply; animal welfare; automation; food production; growth rate; pig; transfer function; water use efficiency; Animalia; Suidae"

At the first visit, a generic questionnaire was held was held on the criteria farmers used for selecting cows on the alert list to be visually checked. During each visit, the farmers were questioned about the specific alerts on the alert list of that day. After this questioning, the milk of all four quarters of every cow on the alert list was visually checked for clinical mastitis and was checked for subclinical mastitis using the CMT test. Important criteria for farmers were, an alarming change in milk production, flakes and/or clots on the milk filter in combination with high electrical conductivity or a failed milking. Reasons for not checking alerts were: no flakes or clots on the milk filter, no change in milk production, cows that were repeatedly on the alert list or a lack of time. Nine percent of all (421) checked alerts had clinical mastitis, while 31 % of all alerts had subclinical mastitis. This means that a total of 40 % of all alerts could be associated with mastitis. The farmers did check 3 % of the alerts, of which 67 % (10 cases) had clinical mastitis. However, 74 % of the clinical mastitis that was associated with mastitis alerts of the mastitis detection system was not diagnosed by the farmer because of his own selection of cows to check. This can be the cause of the observed phenomenon that farms that switch to automatic milking, on average, do have worse udder health in terms of somatic cell count, but a lower incidence of clinical mastitis. The eventual consequences of this lack of detection of clinical mastitis on overall udder health, use of antibiotics, animal welfare and milk quality remain unknown.","Automatic milking; Farmers' behaviour; Interpretation; Mastitis alert list","Agriculture; Automatic milking; Clinical mastitis; Farmers' behaviour; High electrical conductivity; Interpretation; Mastitis alert list; Somatic cell count; Subclinical mastitis; Diseases"

To determine how the number of days of sampling, parity, stage of lactation, and production level affect lying time, electronic data loggers were used to record lying time for 10 d consecutively, at 3 stages of lactation [early: when cows were at 10-40 d in milk (DIM), mid: 100-140 DIM, late: 200-240 DIM] of 96 Holstein cows in tiestalls (TS) and 127 in freestalls (FS). We calculated daily duration of lying, bout frequency, and mean bout duration. We observed complex interactions between parity and stage of lactation, which differed somewhat between tiestalls and freestalls. First-parity cows had higher bout frequency and shorter lying bouts than older cows but bout frequency decreased and mean bout duration increased as DIM increased. We found that individual cows were not consistent in time spent lying between early and mid lactation (Pearson coefficient, TS: r = 0.1, FS: r = 0.2), whereas cows seemed to be more consistent in time spent lying between mid and late lactation (TS: r = 0.7, FS: r = 0.3). For both TS and FS cows, daily milk production was significantly, but slightly negatively, correlated with lying time across the lactation (range, r: -0.2 to -0.4), whereas parity was slightly to moderately positively correlated with mean bout duration across the lactation (r: +0.2 to +0.6) and negatively with bout frequency (r: -0.2 to -0.5). To estimate how the duration of the time sample affected the estimates of lying time subsets of data subsets consisting of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 d per cow were created, and the relationship between the overall mean (based on 10 d) and the mean of each subset was tested by regression. For both TS and FS, lying time based on 4 d of sampling provided good estimates of the average 10-d estimate (90% of accuracy). Automated monitoring of lying time has potential as a measure of dairy cow welfare on commercial farms but cows differ greatly in lying time. To obtain a representative measure for the herd, it is necessary to sample cows based on their parity and stage of lactation but probably not milk production level. © 2012 American Dairy Science Association.","Dairy cow; Freestall; Lying time; Tiestall","animal; animal housing; animal welfare; article; body posture; cattle; dairy product; epidemiology; female; lactation; physiology; standard; time; Animal Welfare; Animals; Cattle; Dairy Products; Female; Housing, Animal; Lactation; Posture; Sampling Studies; Time Factors"

Pressure to maximize efficiency and lower inputs has resulted in novel approaches to managing and milking dairy herds, including implementation of automatic milking systems (AMS) to reduce labor associated with milking. Although AMS have been used for almost 20 yr in Europe, they have only recently become more popular in North America. Automatic milking systems have the potential to increase milk production by up to 12%, decrease labor by as much as 18%, and simultaneously improve dairy cow welfare by allowing cows to choose when to be milked. However, producers using AMS may not fully realize these anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons. For example, producers may not see a reduction in labor because some cows do not milk voluntarily or because they have not fully or efficiently incorporated the AMS into their management routines. Following the introduction of AMS on the market in the 1990s, research has been conducted examining AMS systems versus conventional parlors focusing primarily on cow health, milk yield, and milk quality, as well as on some of the economic and social factors related to AMS adoption. Additionally, because AMS rely on cows milking themselves voluntarily, research has also been conducted on the behavior of cows in AMS facilities, with particular attention paid to cow traffic around AMS, cow use of AMS, and cows' motivation to enter the milking stall. However, the sometimes contradictory findings resulting from different studies on the same aspect of AMS suggest that differences in management and farm-level variables may be more important to AMS efficiency and milk production than features of the milking system itself. Furthermore, some of the recommendations that have been made regarding AMS facility design and management should be scientifically tested to demonstrate their validity, as not all may work as intended. As updated AMS designs, such as the automatic rotary milking parlor, continue to be introduced to the dairy industry, research must continue to be conducted on AMS to understand the causes and consequences of differences between milking systems as well as the impacts of the different facilities and management systems that surround them on dairy cow behavior, health, and welfare. © 2012 American Dairy Science Association.","Automatic milking system; Behavior; Health; Robotic milking machine","animal; animal behavior; animal welfare; cattle; cattle disease; dairying; feeding behavior; female; instrumentation; lactation; methodology; physiological stress; review; Animal Welfare; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Dairying; Feeding Behavior; Female; Lactation; Stress, Physiological"

However, history suggests that there is a limit to the improvements capable of being secured by this approach. In this paper, it is argued that economic principles can and should have an important role when new, market-driven and other approaches are set up to improve farm animal welfare. The paper focuses on two ways in which economic principles can improve analyses of animal welfare. The first is by helping to define priorities as to which aspects of animal welfare should be promoted. Here, economic approaches can be used to capture and synthesise the perspectives of all the stakeholders, including the animals, in a transparent and systematic way. The second way is by helping to ensure that incentives are set up in the right way. Where the benefits and costs of improving animal welfare are initially distributed unevenly across stakeholders so that a socially desirable situation will not develop automatically, or be implemented, suitable economic principles may help to create incentives which correct this situation. Thus, if society is to achieve its goal of improving animal welfare, scholars from different disciplines should collaborate in identifying animal needs, assessing stakeholder preferences, making priorities transparent and providing incentives that make solutions realistically attainable. © 2012 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.","Animal welfare; Economics; Incentives; Priorities; Stakeholders; Transparency","animal housing; animal welfare; cost; dairy cattle; Denmark; economic aspect; farm animal; human; nonhuman; personnel management; public-private partnership; review; sow (swine); Animalia"

As organic agriculture aims at sustainable production, the introduction of a new technology such as AMS should be evaluated regarding its economic viability, environmental impact, and social acceptability, i.e., its contribution to sustainable development. The objective of this research, therefore, was to evaluate sustainability of AMS use on organic dairy farms in Denmark, by comparing results of a set of sustainability indicators for nine farms using AMS with nine farms using conventional milking systems (CMS). Sustainability indicators were quantified for economic performance of the farm, on-farm eutrophication, on-farm biodiversity, animal welfare (including health), grazing time, milk composition and labour time. Milk yield per cow per year was higher for AMS farms (9021 kg energy corrected milk [ECM] per cow per year) than for CMS farms (7664 kg ECM), but did not result in a higher net profit or gross margin per cow for AMS farms. Nitrogen surplus per hectare of available land was higher for AMS farms (110 kg N ha -1) than for CMS farms (66 kg N ha -1). This difference was not due to the use of AMS but was caused by a higher export of manure by the CMS farms. The number of veterinary treatments per cow per year was unaffected by AMS use, but culling rate was higher for the AMS farms (38%) than for the CMS farms (32%). There was no difference between the AMS and CMS farms in milk composition indicators such as somatic cell count, clostridium spores, and urea. The acid degree value (ADV), measuring free fatty acids (FFA) in the milk, was higher in the milk from the AMS farms (0.78 meq l -l) compared with the CMS farms (0.49 meq l -l). Labour time measured in hours of work per dairy cow per day, was only half for the AMS compared with the CMS users; i.e., 2.3 min per cow per day. Grass intake by grazing as percentage of total feed intake was reduced by AMS (5.1 kg DM per cow per day for the AMS farms against 6.8 kg DM per cow per day for the CMS farms). From this quantification of selected sustainability indicators it can be concluded that organic dairy farms using AMS, in spite of the substantial decrease in grazing time, show the potential of economic and environmental sustainable development within the range of herd sizes investigated (65-157 cows per farm). Even though the lower number of grazing hours per cow per year on the AMS farms did not affect indicator scores for animal health or milk quality, this reduction in grazing hours might be a problem for consumers to accept AMS use. © 2011 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences.","Automatic milking system; Grazing; Organic dairy farming; Sustainability indicators","advanced technology; animal welfare; bioindicator; chemical composition; dairy farming; environmental impact; fatty acid; food intake; grazing management; milk; milk production; nitrogen; organic farming; research work; sustainability; sustainable development; Denmark; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bos; Clostridium"

Gait scoring techniques and claw health reports are commonly used for research and surveys, but few daily management solutions exist to monitor gait parameters from individual cows within a herd. A tool to automate and process the measurement of spatiotemporal kinematic and force variables was developed using a pressure sensitive walkway, commercial farm infrastructure and management tools. A fully automatic setup on ILVO's experimental farm measures and analyses the gait of each cow that exits the milking parlour by registration of 20 basic kinematic gait variables. Based on this variable set, a wide range of typical gait parameters such as triple support time, abduction, etc. can be calculated. This paper presents some practical results and considerations related to this system of automated gait analysis. A first validation of the acquired variables shows that the Gaitwise system is capable of clustering observations in relation to the observer score with an overall sensitivity of 76-90% and specificity of 86-100%. Variables of asymmetry and speed seem most promising for further research on the detection of lameness.For future reference, the resulting cow gait variables will be stored for time series analysis to detect changes in individual cow walking behaviour in relation to any source (claw lesions, gestation stage, etc.). Such measurements could provide valuable information for management, veterinary check-ups and further research for automatic lameness detection in cattle. © 2011 IAgrE.",,"Kinematics; Animal welfare; Commercial farms; Gait parameters; Gait tracking; Lameness detection; Management tool; Pressure sensitive; Scoring techniques; Time series analysis; Animalia; Bos"

'Optical flow' describes the velocity of image motion across an eye or camera and statistical patterns can be derived automatically and continuously throughout the life of a flock. We provide descriptive statistics (mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis) of optical flow of 10 intensively housed commercial broiler flocks between the ages of 32 and 35 days. There were no significant correlations between any of these measures and flock mortality. However, all four measures were correlated significantly with the % of birds in a house showing poor walking (high gait scores). Furthermore, these gait scores were highly negatively correlated with the % of time chickens spent walking and with their stride rate (no. of strides/min), as measured by focal behaviour analysis of individual birds from the same video records. The results suggest that optical flow measures have the potential to be used as an adjunct or even a substitute for gait scoring on commercial farms with the added advantage that the measurements could be made continuously throughout the life of a flock, are fully automated, completely non-invasive and non-intrusive and do not involve the biosecurity risk of having people visiting different farms to carry out gait scoring. The correlations between gait scores and optical flow also suggest that gait scoring itself has an objective basis. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These systems automatically collect various kinds of information about an animal and allow the farmer to monitor it remotely. It is argued that the relationship between the farmer and the individual animal is becoming increasingly distant and impoverished. Although this may protect the animal from some negative interactions, it is less clear whether use of these systems will lead to an increase in positive interactions of the kind beneficial for animal welfare. Furthermore, the measurement of specific parameters replaces observation of the animal as a whole, which may affect the perception of the animal. As automation systems replace traditional tasks, the role of the farmer is changing drastically. This may lead to deskilling in the farmer, which in turn may affect animal welfare. The value of automation systems in increasing productivity is clear; however, this paper questions the extent to which these systems can be used to enhance animal welfare. It is argued that ethically acceptable development of automation systems for farm animals can only be achieved if these systems prove to be beneficial in respect of animal welfare. © ISAZ 2009.","Animal welfare; Automation systems; Ethics; Human-animal relationship","animal welfare; automation; ethics; human behavior; Animalia"

The assessment is made in close relation to the stakeholders that have been determined. This assessment is based on current available knowledge which does not differentiate between organic and conventional management. Net farm income on conventional dairy farms introducing AMS does not increase significantly, neither is this expected for organic AMS farms. The time saving effect results in social but not economic advantages. Introduction of AMS on conventional farms in combination with grazing, results in a small increase in fossil energy use per kg milk, and an increase in eutrophication per ha farm area due to less efficient use of total grazing area. Similar results are to be expected for organic AMS dairy farms. Introduction of AMS does not result in animal health problems for conventional farms, and is not expected to result in problems for organic farms. Concerning cow welfare, the relation between use of AMS and grazing required in organic production is essential. Milk quality decreases due to the introduction of AMS at conventional farms, and might have a similar effect at organic farms. Farmers', consumers' and other defined stakeholders' perceptions of the selected sustainability aspects have hardly been investigated. Conventional farmers express satisfaction when asked after having invested in AMS. It is crucial to communicate with stakeholders about the different aspects of innovative technology and even more important to organic consumers that show major concern for product quality, ecology and animal welfare.","AMS; Organic dairy; Pasture grazing; Sustainability indicators","AMS; Animal welfare; Automatic milking; Economic advantages; Innovative technology; Organic production; Pasture grazing; Sustainability indicators; Dairies; Eutrophication; Surveys; Sustainable development; Veterinary medicine; Farms"

The project focused on farm-level adoption determinants of automatic milking, on-farm social-economic and environmental implications, societal acceptance, impact on milk quality, impacts on animal health and welfare and requirements for management. Economy of automatic milking is determined by the value of labor savings, the value of the expected additional milk yield and costs saved on investment in a conventional milking parlor. So where labor costs are high or more spare time is highly appreciated, automatic milking becomes an attractive alternative. In Europe, present adopters are middle sized enterprises with relative high numbers of cows (50-100) and quota >500.000 kg. Automatic milking urged a new definition of abnormal milk in the EU Hygiene Directive. Although milk quality requires attention during the transition period from conventional to automatic milking, in general no serious problems are encountered afterwards; accept the issue of free fatty acids. Moreover, the importance of farm hygiene, adequate udder and teat cleaning and accurate system cleaning should be stressed. When changing to automatic milking, hardly any negative or positive effects on animal health and welfare are observed. Udder health, particularly in fresh cows, and claw health should be carefully monitored, especially when the herd is kept indoors. Finally, for the sake of improved management support, the industry is challenged to realize a better integration between milking system and herd management software, to improve control functions of the milking system and to further develop sensors for management support.","Animal health and well being; Automatic milking system; Economy; Farm management; Grazing systems; Milk quality","Costs; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Investments; Project management; Research; Sensors; Animal health and well being; Automatic milking system; Economy; Farm management; Grazing systems; Milk quality; Milking machines; Costs; Economic Analysis; Investment; Milk; Planning; Research; Sensors"

As cow traffic may be affected by restricted locomotion, lameness may be a significant problem in herds with automatic milking systems (AMSs).

Herd sizes ranged from 60 (n = 5 herds with one automatic milking unit [AMU]) to 120 cows (n = 3 herds with two AMU.5). Four visits were made, during which 40-50 cows were randomly assigned for clinical examination of body. condition, cleanliness, claw length, disorders of claws and legs, lameness, pressure lesions, and disorders of udder and teats. Lameness was observed in 14% of cows, ranging from 5% to 28% between herds. Approximately 60% of cows had pressure lesions on the hock and 23% of cows had overgrown claws.

New barns are, however, mostly loose housing units where the animals are group housed and normally have space to evade people. As group housed cattle can be less habituated to humans, they may be more difficult to handle compared to individually housed and they may become fearful of people. Fear is a negative feeling and continuous fear causes stress. That is why cattle should not be fearful of humans. Fear of humans can be avoided with positive human contact, which is especially effective to young calves. However, regularity of positive interactions is also important. The number of cattle per farm is increasing in Europe. The farmer is, therefore, facing the question of how to manage all the work at the farm. Professional stockpeople are difficult to find and the labour is expensive compared to the price of milk or meat. Technology could be a solution to these problems. This situation will lead to reduced human-cattle interactions and increased cattle-machine interactions. Thus, in modern European cattle husbandry, the time to individual handling and care of cattle will diminish, despite the fact that the individual care has been highly valued. The question is also, do we need individual handling of cattle or should we instead develop group handling methods. Cattle do not necessarily want to interact with humans apart from the situation when people offer them something to eat. A group of cattle is also known to alleviate the stress experiences of its members. If the welfare of cattle is to be secured, a need for individual care will remain. Absolutely reliable automatic instruments for health detection of cows have not existed until now and thus, the stockperson has had to identify individual cows from the group. Human-cattle interaction studies are mainly done with individually housed animals. Therefore, the effect of group housing and group size on human-cattle interactions needs to be studied. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Public discussion has stimulated research in this field, financed by both government and industry. Dutch society in general and consumers of animal products in particular, want to see high standards of welfare for production animals. Good animal welfare has gradually gained more impact in the total quality concept of the product. This will encourage scientists to continue to analyse the welfare status of animals and to come up with innovative solutions for the remaining problems At ID-Lelystad much effort is put into farm animal welfare research. This research includes for example, the development of behavioural tests for quantifying and interpreting fear in cattle, investigations into the effects of dietary iron supply and a lack of roughage on behaviour, immunology, stress physiology, and pathology in veal calves, studies of the ontogeny of tail biting in finishing pigs and feather pecking in laying hens as well as evaluation of the welfare effects of automatic milking in dairy cows. The results of these projects contribute to concrete improvements in animal husbandry and expertise and support policy making and legislation. The animal industry as well as retailers should aim at the further implementation of this knowledge and to specify welfare standards to guarantee consumer acceptance of animal production. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"animal; animal behavior; animal husbandry; animal welfare; cattle; chicken; consumer; dairying; domestic animal; legal aspect; methodology; Netherlands; physiology; psychological aspect; quality control; research; review; safety; standard; swine; Animal Husbandry; Animal Welfare; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Behavior, Animal; Cattle; Chickens; Consumer Product Safety; Consumer Satisfaction; Dairying; Netherlands; Quality Control; Research; Swine"
