Panting score (PS) is considered a robust indicator of cattle heat stress; however, individualised visual monitoring is impractical. Thermal index-based monitoring and mitigation decisions are applied at the herd level, but they have limited application for the individual animal. As such, an automated system to monitor the real-time animal response to heat stress is required for strategic mitigation. Our objectives were to validate an accelerometer-based ear tag sensor to monitor cattle panting and to determine individual variability in heat stress responses with reference to thermal indices. Two experiments were conducted: Experiment 1 validated the sensors, and Experiment 2 determined individual variability comparing sensor data against thermal indices. Ear tag sensors were fitted at feedlot entry to continuously monitor the behaviour of 100 steers of mixed breed in Experiment 1 and 200 steers and heifers of mixed breed in Experiment 2. Sensor-derived ‘heavy breathing’ was validated against visually observed PS. Sensor-derived behaviour bouts were analysed as ‘raw’, and single behaviour states were also converted to the preceding bout of ≥2 min, which was referred to as ‘fill’ data for the validation study. Our results demonstrate the sensors’ ability to accurately monitor panting in feedlot cattle. Sensor-recorded ‘heavy breathing’ duration per animal was highly correlated to observed panting duration for both raw (r = 0.89) and fill (r = 0.90) data; however, the concordance correlation co-efficient was lower for raw (0.45) as compared with fill (0.76). Predicted agreement for raw data were 75%, 45%, and 68% and predicted agreement for fill data were 65%, 54%, and 83% for PS0, PS1, and PS2, respectively. Sensitivity for raw data were 39%, 37%, and 45% and for fill data, they were 59%, 54% and 82% for all PS data, PS1 and PS2, respectively. Specificity and positive predictive values for both raw (77% and 79%, respectively) and fill (65% and 77%, respectively) data show the probability of reporting false positives by sensors to be low. Experiment 2 revealed that the duration of panting increased from 0800 to 1700 h alongside changes in thermal indices with significant differences between and within breed and coat colour categories of cattle, suggesting that grouping and allocating heat amelioration measures by breed and coat colour can be effective in commercial feedlots. However, there was high variability (CV > 80%) in the duration of panting between individuals within the same breed and same coat colour, revealing the potential for strategic management at an individual level, and with the same data, genetic selection for heat resilience. © 2020 by the authors.

This creates new opportunities to study livestock behavior in commercial settings, but also new methodological challenges. Densely sampled behavioral data from large heterogeneous groups can contain a range of complex patterns and stochastic structures that may be difficult to visualize using conventional exploratory data analysis techniques. The goal of this research was to assess the efficacy of unsupervised machine learning tools in recovering complex behavioral patterns from such datasets to better inform subsequent statistical modeling. This methodological case study was carried out using records on milking order, or the sequence in which cows arrange themselves as they enter the milking parlor. Data was collected over a 6-month period from a closed group of 200 mixed-parity Holstein cattle on an organic dairy. Cows at the front and rear of the queue proved more consistent in their entry position than animals at the center of the queue, a systematic pattern of heterogeneity more clearly visualized using entropy estimates, a scale and distribution-free alternative to variance robust to outliers. Dimension reduction techniques were then used to visualize relationships between cows. No evidence of social cohesion was recovered, but Diffusion Map embeddings proved more adept than PCA at revealing the underlying linear geometry of this data. Median parlor entry positions from the pre- and post-pasture subperiods were highly correlated (R = 0.91), suggesting a surprising degree of temporal stationarity. Data Mechanics visualizations, however, revealed heterogeneous non-stationary among subgroups of animals in the center of the group and herd-level temporal outliers. A repeated measures model recovered inconsistent evidence of a relationships between entry position and cow attributes. Mutual conditional entropy tests, a permutation-based approach to assessing bivariate correlations robust to non-independence, confirmed a significant but non-linear association with peak milk yield, but revealed the age effect to be potentially confounded by health status. Finally, queueing records were related back to behaviors recorded via ear tag accelerometers using linear models and mutual conditional entropy tests. Both approaches recovered consistent evidence of differences in home pen behaviors across subsections of the queue. © Copyright © 2020 McVey, Hsieh, Manriquez, Pinedo and Horback.","data mechanics; entropy; exploratory data analysis; manifold learning; milking order; precision livestock; unsupervised machine learning","animal behavior; animal experiment; Article; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; controlled study; cow; dimensionality reduction; embedding; entropy; geometry; herd; Holstein cattle; livestock; mechanics; nonhuman; parity; pasture; statistical model; unsupervised machine learning"

It consequently may modify how farmers consider their animals, the quality of the human-animal relationship and animal welfare. To better understand how new technologies impact human-animal relationships on the farm, a survey was carried out on 25 livestock farms in France. The farms raised dairy cows, gestating sows or broiler chickens using different equipment (sensors associated or not with robots). A qualitative thematic analysis to better identify farmers’ views on the different topics, and secondly a statistical analysis to identify if farmer profiles exist and to better understand the diversity of views were conducted. Most of the farmers expressed satisfaction about working with the new technology because their work becomes easier and allows more control over the management of the animals. Using PLF, the farmers describe a profession that has not fundamentally changed but which involves new tasks, new skills and daily schedules. Three farmers’ profiles were identified. Profile A farmers consider that one cannot talk about a human-animal relationship on their farm, and do not enjoy either touching or talking to their animals. Profile B farmers associate a good human-animal relationship with the animals’ welfare. Profile C is characterized by the central place occupied by animals and associate a good human-animal relationship with an absence of fear on the part of the animals. Farmers motivated by animals (profile C) find in precision livestock farming benefits related to animals, while the others (profiles A and B) find technical benefits detached from the animals. The farmers have room to manoeuvre in how they use the equipment; this can be seen for instance in the degree to which tasks are delegated to the equipment, which can be partial or total. Nevertheless, some farmers expressed concerns regarding the place of the new technologies on the farm, such as the risk of losing their own autonomy or their ability to observe animals and detect problems. Complementary studies could monitor these developments and contribute elements on the role of PLF in the sustainability of livestock farms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Human-animal relationship; Livestock farmer profession; Precision livestock farming; Robot; Sensor; Work","accuracy; adult; agricultural worker; animal care; animal welfare; Article; biodiversity; broiler chicken; chicken; controlled study; dairy cattle; France; gestating sows; human; human animal relationship; job satisfaction; livestock; nonhuman; precision livestock farming; priority journal; qualitative analysis; skill; social behavior; sow (swine); statistical analysis; tactile communication; task performance; technology; thematic analysis; touch"

Such improvement has been accompanied by the intensification of production systems, use of a wider range of precision technologies in routine management practices, and high-throughput phenotyping. Simultaneously, a greater public awareness of animal welfare has influenced livestock producers to place more emphasis on welfare relative to production traits. Therefore, management practices and breeding technologies in livestock have been developed in recent years to enhance animal welfare. In particular, genomic selection can be used to improve livestock social behavior, resilience to disease and other stress factors, and ease habituation to production system changes. The main requirements for including novel behavioral and welfare traits in genomic breeding schemes are: (1) to identify traits that represent the biological mechanisms of the industry breeding goals; (2) the availability of individual phenotypic records measured on a large number of animals (ideally with genomic information); (3) the derived traits are heritable, biologically meaningful, repeatable, and (ideally) not highly correlated with other traits already included in the selection indexes; and (4) genomic information is available for a large number of individuals (or genetically close individuals) with phenotypic records. In this review, we (1) describe a potential route for development of novel welfare indicator traits (using ideal phenotypes) for both genetic and genomic selection schemes; (2) summarize key indicator variables of livestock behavior and welfare, including a detailed assessment of thermal stress in livestock; (3) describe the primary statistical and bioinformatic methods available for large-scale data analyses of animal welfare; and (4) identify major advancements, challenges, and opportunities to generate high-throughput and large-scale datasets to enable genetic and genomic selection for improved welfare in livestock. A wide variety of novel welfare indicator traits can be derived from information captured by modern technology such as sensors, automatic feeding systems, milking robots, activity monitors, video cameras, and indirect biomarkers at the cellular and physiological levels. The development of novel traits coupled with genomic selection schemes for improved welfare in livestock can be feasible and optimized based on recently developed (or developing) technologies. Efficient implementation of genetic and genomic selection for improved animal welfare also requires the integration of a multitude of scientific fields such as cell and molecular biology, neuroscience, immunology, stress physiology, computer science, engineering, quantitative genomics, and bioinformatics. © Copyright © 2020 Brito, Oliveira, McConn, Schinckel, Arrazola, Marchant-Forde and Johnson.","behavioral genomics; big data; digital agriculture; genomic information; genomic selection; novel phenotypes; phenomics; precision livestock",

The ear tag has an acceleration sensor, a radio chip, and temperature sensor for calibration and it can monitor rumination and detect estrus and localization. To validate the ear tag, a noseband sensor (RumiWatch, Itin and Hoch GmbH, Liestal, Switzerland) was used. The noseband sensor detects pressure and acceleration patterns, and, with a software program specific to the noseband, pressure and acceleration patterns are used to classify data into eating, ruminating, drinking, and other activities. The study was conducted at the University of Minnesota West Central Research and Outreach Center (Morris, MN) and at Teagasc Animal and Grassland Research and Innovation Centre (Moorepark, Fermoy, Co. Cork, Ireland). During May and June 2017, observational data from Minnesota and Ireland were used to develop the grazing algorithm. During September 2018, data were collected by the ear tag and noseband sensor from 12 crossbred cows in Minnesota for a total of 248 h and from 9 Holstein-Friesian cows in Ireland for a total of 248 h. A 2-sided t-test was used to compare the percentage of grazing and nongrazing time recorded by the ear tag and the noseband sensor. Pearson correlations and concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) were used to evaluate associations between the ear tag and noseband sensor. The percentage of total grazing time recorded by the ear tag and by the noseband sensor was 37.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 32.1 to 42.0] and 40.5% (95% CI: 35.5 to 45.6), respectively, in Minnesota, and 35.4% (95% CI: 30.6 to 40.2) and 36.9% (95% CI: 32.1 to 41.8), respectively, in Ireland. The ear tag and noseband sensor agreed strongly for monitoring grazing in Minnesota (r = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94 to 0.97, CCC = 0.95) and in Ireland (r = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.90 to 0.94, CCC = 0.92). The results suggest that there is potential for the ear tag to be used on pasture-based dairy farms to support management decision-making. © 2020 American Dairy Science Association","accelerometer; ear tag; grazing; validation","accelerometry; animal; bovine; dairying; devices; drinking; ear; estrus; female; herbivory; lactation; physiologic monitoring; veterinary medicine; Accelerometry; Animals; Cattle; Dairying; Drinking; Ear; Estrus; Female; Herbivory; Lactation; Monitoring, Physiologic"

The primary reason behind this is the high initial setup costs, complex equipment and lack of multi-vendor interoperability in currently available solutions. On the other hand, human observation based solutions relying on visual inspections are prone to late detection with possible human error, and are not scalable. This poses a concern with increasing herd sizes, as prolonged or undetected lameness severely compromises cows' health and welfare, and ultimately affects the milk productivity of the farm. To tackle this, we have developed an end-to-end IoT application that leverages advanced machine learning and data analytics techniques to monitor the cattle in real-time and identify lame cattle at an early stage. The proposed approach has been validated on a real world smart dairy farm setup consisting of a dairy herd of 150 cows in Waterford, Ireland. Using long-range pedometers specifically designed for use in dairy cattle, we monitor the activity of each cow in the herd. The accelerometric data from these sensors is aggregated at the fog node to form a time series of behavioral activities, which are further analyzed in the cloud. Our hybrid clustering and classification model identifies each cow as either Active, Normal or Dormant, and further, Lame or Non-Lame. The detected lameness anomalies are further sent to farmer's mobile device by way of push notifications. The results indicate that we can detect lameness 3 days before it can be visually captured by the farmer with an overall accuracy of 87%. This means that the animal can either be isolated or treated immediately to avoid any further effects of lameness. Moreover, with fog based computational assistance in the setup, we see an 84% reduction in amount of data transferred to the cloud as compared to the conventional cloud based approach. © 2020 The Authors","Classification; Cloud computing; Clustering; Data analytics; Data-driven; Fog computing; Internet of Things (IoT); Machine learning; Microservices; Smart dairy farming; Smart farm","Advanced Analytics; Agriculture; Classification (of information); Cloud computing; Dairies; Data Analytics; Fog; Internet of things; Learning systems; Machine learning; Mobile telecommunication systems; Clustering; Dairy farming; Data driven; Internet of Things (IOT); Microservices; Fog computing; cattle; classification; computer; dairy farming; data assimilation; equipment component; machine learning; time series analysis; World Wide Web; Ireland; Munster [Ireland]; Waterford; Animalia; Bos"

Accelerometers are particularly suited for monitoring cow behaviors due to small size, lightweight and high accuracy. Nevertheless, the interpretation of the data collected by such sensors when characterizing the type of behaviors still brings major challenges to developers, related to activity complexity (i.e., certain behaviors contain similar gestures). This paper presents a new design of cows' behavior classifier based on acceleration data and proposed feature set. Analysis of cow acceleration data is used to extract features for classification using machine learning algorithms. We found that with 5 features (mean, standard deviation, root mean square, median, range) and 16-second window of data (1 sample/second), classification of seven cow behaviors (including feeding, lying, standing, lying down, standing up, normal walking, active walking) achieved the overall highest performance. We validated the results with acceleration data from a public source. Performance of our proposed classifier was evaluated and compared to existing ones in terms of the sensitivity, the accuracy, the positive predictive value, and the negative predictive value. © 2020 the Author(s).","Acceleration; Classification; Cow; Monitoring; Sensor","Agriculture; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Walking aids; Acceleration data; Active walkings; Analysis of data; Negative predictive value; Normal walking; Positive predictive values; Root Mean Square; Standard deviation; Classification (of information)"

Subtle modifications in behaviour can materialise just before clinical signs of a disease. Recent sensor developments enable continuous monitoring of animal behaviour, but the shift to abnormal animal activity remains difficult to detect. We explored the use of Machine Learning (ML) to detect abnormal behaviour from continuous monitoring. We submitted 14 cows (Bos taurus) to Sub-Acute Ruminal Acidosis (SARA), a disease known to induce changes in behaviour. Another 14 control cows were not submitted to SARA. We used a ruminal bolus to monitor pH and detect when a cow experienced SARA. We used a positioning system to infer an animal's activity based on its position in relation to specific elements in the barn (feeder, resting area, and alleys). We tested several ML algorithms: K Nearest Neighbours for Regression (KNNR); Decision Tree for Regression (DTR); MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP); Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM); and an algorithm where activity is assumed to be similar from one day to the next. First, we developed ML models to predict activity on a given day from the previous 24 h, considering all cows together. Then, we calculated the error between observed and predicted values for a given cow. Finally, we compared the error to a threshold chosen to optimise the distinction between normal and abnormal values. KNNR performed best, detecting 83% of SARA cases (true-positives), but it also produced 66% of false-positives, which limits its use in practice. In conclusion, ML can help detect anomalies in behaviour. Further improvements could probably be obtained by applying ML on very large datasets at animal rather than group level. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cattle; Data mining; Metabolic disease; Real-Time Locating System; Sickness behaviour","Animals; Data mining; Decision trees; Diseases; Large dataset; Machine learning; Monitoring; Nearest neighbor search; Trees (mathematics); Abnormal behaviours; Cattle; Continuous monitoring; K-nearest neighbours; Metabolic disease; Multi layer perceptron; Real-Time Locating Systems; Sickness behaviour; Long short-term memory; algorithm; behavioral response; biomonitoring; cattle; data mining; disease incidence; machine learning; pH; real time; sensor; Animalia; Bos; Bos taurus"

An experiment was conducted to collect and validate data from the behaviour monitoring system. A water trough located in an enclosed water point was equipped with a water flow meter. The water point entry and exit gates were each fitted with a RFID panel reader. The eight beef heifers that grazed the experimental site wore a RFID ear tag in the right ear and a motion sensing neck collar that contained a triaxial accelerometer. The heifers had ad libitum access to the water point at all times. Sensor data and video observations were recorded over four consecutive weeks. When operational, the RFID readers correctly recorded 95% (94/99) of heifer movements in and out of the water point and were correlated (r = 0.99) to observed entry and exit times. Volumes of water recorded by the water meter were correlated (r = 0.99) to measured water volumes taken from the trough's inlet and from water in the trough while under the control of a float valve. An algorithm was developed to classify drinking using accelerometer measures of head-neck position, activity and movement frequency. The accelerometer algorithm detected 94% (98/104) of drinking events that were greater than 10 s in duration (F1 score = 77%) and was correlated (r = 0.84) to the observed duration of drinking events. Differences between observed and predicted estimates of the number of drinking events that were greater than 10 s in duration (1.6 ± 1.1 vs. 2.0 ± 1.8, respectively) and the time spent drinking (45.8 ± 24.1 vs. 43.1 ± 42.8, respectively) per heifer visit to the water yard were not significant (p > 0.05). The approach is considered reliable for recording a number of behavioural measures including the number, duration and frequency of visits per animal to a water point, the number and duration of drinking events per animal visit and the time each animal spends drinking. © 2019","Accelerometer; Beef; Biotechnology; Power spectral analysis; Radio frequency IDentification","Accelerometers; Animals; Beef; Biotechnology; Flow measurement; Flow of water; Flowmeters; Hydraulics; Inlet flow; Monitoring; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Radio waves; Spectrum analysis; Automated approach; Behaviour monitoring; Grazing systems; Motion sensing; Movement frequencies; Power spectral analysis; Triaxial accelerometer; Water volumes; Potable water; algorithm; behavior; biotechnology; cattle; drinking; equipment; experimental study; grazing; identification method; monitoring system; sensor; spectral analysis; Animalia; Bos"

Seventy-four Holstein Friesian calves were individually penned and allocated to receive either high (HML) or conventional (CML) milk replacer (MR) levels between 5–70 days of age. Additionally calves were allocated to one of four forage treatments: (i) chopped straw offered between 14–70 days of age (CS14), (ii) chopped straw offered between 56–70 days of age (CS56), (iii) grass silage offered between 56–70 days of age (GS56), and (iv) no forage in the pre-wean period (NF). A representative sample of calves from each treatment were fitted with activity sensors and heart rate monitors throughout the experimental period to examine lying behaviour and heart rate variability, respectively. Thermal images of the eye and rectal area of each calf were taken 5 days/week between 5–77 days of age. Faecal and respiratory scoring of each individual calf was carried out on a daily basis throughout the experimental period. Milk replacer feeding level had limited effects on measures of calf health, although HML calves tended to have an increased likelihood for receiving treatment for scour than CML calves. Daily lying time (min/d) was lower in HML calves following reduction in MR feeding frequency at 43 days of age and weaning at 71 days of age when compared with CML calves. Additionally, HML calves displayed a lower heart rate variability following weaning, this suggestive of increased stress load. There were limited effects of forage treatment, however, CS14 calves displayed a greater daily lying time following MR stepdown at 68 days of age, this potentially indicating increased rumination. Results of the present study highlight the benefits of using remote monitoring technologies as a means of detecting behavioural and physiological changes as a result of nutritional management strategy in individually housed dairy calves. © 2019 by the authors.

Nowadays, animal tracking solutions based on global positioning systems (GPS) are commercially available. However, existing devices have several constraints, mostly related to wireless data transmission and financial cost, which make impractical the monitorization of all the animals in a herd. The main objective of this work is to develop a low-cost solution to enable the monitorization of a whole herd. An IoT-based system, which requires some animals of the herd being fitted with GPS collars connected to a Sigfox network and the rest with low-cost Bluetooth tags, has been developed. Its performance has been tested in two commercial farms, raising sheep and beef cattle, through the monitorization of 50 females in each case. Several collar/tag ratios, which define the cost per animal of the solution, have been simulated. Results demonstrate that a low collar/tag ratio enable the monitorization of a whole sheep herd. A larger ratio is needed for beef cows because of their grazing behavior. Nevertheless, the optimal ratio depends on the purpose of location data. Large variability has been observed for the number of hourly and daily messages from collars and tags. The system effectiveness for the monitorization of all the animals in a herd has been certainly proved. © 2019 by the authors.

Swine practitioners, by virtue of their animal and client advocacy roles, interpretation of benchmarking data, and stewardship in regulatory and traceability programs, can play a broader role as advisors in the transfer of precision livestock farming technology, and its implications to their clients. © 2019, MDPI AG.

For cattle, collar- and ear tag-based accelerometer monitors have been developed to assess the time spent ruminating on an individual animal. Cattle that are ill feed less and so ruminate less, thus, the estimation of the time spent ruminating provides insights into the health of individual animals. pH boluses directly provide information on the reticuloruminal function within the rumen and extended (three hours or more) periods during which the ruminal pH value remains below 5.6 is an indicator that dysfunction and poor welfare are likely. Accelerometers, incorporated into the pH boluses, have been used to indicate changes in behaviour patterns (high/low activity), utilised to detect the onset of oestrus. The paper demonstrates for the first time that by processing the reticuloruminal motion, it is possible to recover rumination periods. Reticuloruminal motion energy and the time between reticuloruminal contractions are used as inputs to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify rumination periods with an overall accuracy of 86.1%, corroborated by neck mounted rumination collars. © 2019 by the authors.

The key questions posed were: To what extent can current scientific knowledge inform a sensor-based approach to welfare evaluations? And, how might this knowledge shape development of commercial monitoring systems? These questions were explored through retrospective classification of published sensor applications using The Five Domains (FD) Model as a framework for animal welfare assessment. A total of 71 studies were reviewed. The results indicate studies specifically evaluating the use of sensors for welfare assessment are limited, though many experiments could still be related to some aspect of welfare. The assessment of sensor utilisation revealed the greatest proportion of applications within the 'Behaviour' Domain (90.1%; n = 64), and the lowest within the 'Health' (25.4%; n = 18) and 'Mental state' Domains (25.4%; n = 18). The review also highlights how different sensor types (location, motion or physiological) differ in their applicability for welfare assessment. This paper is the first to classify published sensor applications using the FD Model as a framework and highlights the potential for sensor technology in sheep welfare monitoring. The results suggest that any attempt to create a commercial sensor-based system for objective welfare assessment will require the integration of more than one sensor type, particularly if multiple Domains are to be addressed. © 2019 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare The Old School, Brewhouse Hill, Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire AL4 8AN, UK","Animal welfare; Five Domains Model; Remote monitoring; Sensor; Sheep; Systematic review","animal behavior; animal health; animal welfare; conceptual framework; environment; mental health; nonhuman; nutrition; remote sensing; Review; sheep; systematic review"

Many methods have been published to monitor abnormal behaviours or components related to animal welfare. Monitoring animal welfare based upon objective physiological measurements, instead of audio-visual scoring of behaviour, would be a step forward. One of the obvious physiological signals related to welfare and stress is heart rate. The objective of this research was to measure heart rate (beat per minutes) on pigs with technology that has come available at large scale for humans and is developed for animals as well. This affordable heart rate monitoring for humans is using the Photo Plethysmography (PPG) technology. We have used PPG sensors on pigs to test whether it allows getting a reliable heart rate signal. We show results of the sensor against a reference measure for heart rate and this for an anesthetized versus a non-anesthetised animal. We have tested three different anatomical body positions (ear, leg and tail) and give results for each body position of the sensor. In summary, we can conclude that the agreement between the cheap PPG-based heart rate technique and a reference sensor goes from 91-97 percentage. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

The objective was to evaluate how a calving alert system, attached to the tail, affects the cow. The system monitors the tail's movements, and the farmer is notified via a text message to the mobile phone approximately one hour before calving. A case-control and an interview study were carried out. In the case-control study, cow behaviour was observed during and after the procedure of attaching the sensor on the tail. Controls were equally prepared, but the sensor was attached and then immediately removed again. The ethogram protocol contained behaviours like, for example, back arching, tail lifting, fidgeting and kicking. The case-control study had to be discontinued due to the sensors causing damage to the cow's tail and therefore, there were too few cows included in the study to be able to determine if there were statistical differences between the test and control cows. In the interview study which included 15 interviewed farmers, 80% stated that the cows' behavioural reaction was negative when the sensor was attached. Almost all farmers had observed damage to the tails after using the sensor and 20% had observed such severe damage that amputation was necessary. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

A more detailed overview of the literature on the research of traditional meat products is also part of our work. This literature review is the basis to examine the adaptability of monitoring systems to free-range conditions, providing a basis for developing a tracking system for Mangalica and Iberian pigs. In our planned project we intend to adapt IT-methods and procedures to free-range pigs for offering an easy to handle, cost-efficient, useful IT-devices for monitor Mangalica and Iberian pigs, a possibility for gathering behavioural information about their pig herds and indirect data on the health status and production parameters of pigs. Changing the daily rhythm, detecting the deviation immediately makes it possible to detect and treat the sick, possibly infectious animals. By evaluating the data collected by the sensors, the farmer can get a comprehensive picture of the pigs kept outdoors without disturbing the animals. The data can be inserted into the production process of traditional products, so the premium quality associated with free-range pigs can be verified. With this adapted technology, it is possible to achieve precision pig keeping under free-range conditions. Traceability and transparency of free range pig production system would be realised and 'labelled product' would be controlled from farm to fork relations. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

Autonomous computer imaging systems can overcome this challenge. The system presented here utilizes a time of flight depth sensor and a digital camera to capture depth and digital images of each sow and litter, housed in individual farrowing stalls. Depth sensors were centered above the stalls on a triangular truss spanning the length of the farrowing room and mounted in waterproof boxes with attached lids, enabling them to easily be waterproofed when cleaning the farrowing room. Each depth sensor was controlled by a mini-PC housed in a waterproof box located on the wall behind the sow for protection of the electronics. Each box also contained a small display monitor for operator ease of access. Images were acquired continuously at 0.2 fps. Data files were transmitted via Ethernet cable to a switch, then to a disk station for storage. This system was implemented in three farrowing rooms, with each room housing 20 sows. Recorded image data were subsequently analyzed to quantify behaviors of the sows and piglets (future work) as affected by dimensions and layout of the farrowing stalls. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

Perching systems are among those worthy of consideration for adoption, since they can increase the laying hens' vertical and horizontal activity space, and also allow them to express their natural roosting behavior, which is an important indicator of good welfare. Yet along with the shift to the perching systems comes the need to investigate whether the new design of such system, such as the location, number, or size of the perches, can accommodate the laying hens' behavioral needs when at rest. These needs are often investigated by observing the laying hens' distribution in the perches. However, such information is seriously lacking or hard to acquire automatically, and the manual collection of the data is not only inefficient, but also disturbs the laying hens even though it's achievable occasionally. To enable continuous monitoring of perch use, time spent at perches and frequency of visits to perches by laying hens, a system for the automatic monitoring of laying hens' perch distribution based on LabVIEW platform was developed, and the main features consist of an on-site data acquisition module, a system calibration module, a data analysis module, and a remote user interface module. The automated monitoring system employs load-cell weighing, video imaging and a data acquisition system. The experiment was carried out in a perch system between August 26, 2015 and September 26, 2015 at the Shang Zhuang Experimental Station of China Agricultural University. The system was equipped by feeders, manure belt, nest boxes, perches, egg belt and etc. The experiment unit housed a breeding group of 80 hens and 8 cockerels, and 15 perches were equipped inside and numbered from 1 to 15. Every weighing node was formed by 2 weight sensors fixed on the cage stents and a two-meter long perch. The weight calibration equation was obtained at the beginning of the experiment by least square fitting the collection value and the actual weight value and was applied to the data acquisition program. A synchronous image was captured by a network camera when the distribution weight data were collected. The laying hens' distribution values on the 6th, 7th and 8th perches for every image were identified manually and then compared with the data calculated by the system to verify the system accuracy. The results showed that the accuracy of the laying hens' average distribution value was higher than 90%, and when the distribution number was less than 6, the accuracy was greater than 99%. There were about 40 hens on the perches at night during the period of the experiment, which indicated the 50% perch utilization. At the age of 70 weeks, the absolute error of the laying hens' average weight between measured manually and calculated by the system was within 0.1 kg. Thus, the simplified system can be applied to monitor the average body weights of laying hens during rearing period. The monitoring system can supply the real-time information of laying hen perch distribution accurately in the perching systems. This paper describes the detailed design and development of the automated monitoring system of laying hens perch distribution. Such a system can provide data support and reference for perching system design of laying hens. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

We tested an accelerometry-based activity monitor, the Kenz Lifecorder EX (LCEX; Suzuken Co Ltd, Nagoya, Japan), to differentiate between foraging and other activities of beef cows in a steeply sloping pasture. Logistic regression (LR) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), two of the most widely used techniques for distinguishing animal activities based on sensing device information, were employed in the analysis. An LCEX device was worn on a collar by each of four cattle over the course of 4 d, during which time the activity (foraging, resting, ruminating, walking, and grooming) of each cow was recorded by trained observers at 1-min intervals for a total of 15 h. LR and LDA were applied to the LCEX and observer data to distinguish between foraging and other activities. Overall, a more accurate measure was obtained by LDA (90.6% to 94.6% correct discrimination among cows) than by LR (80.8% to 91.8% correct discrimination). The threshold LCEX value for distinguishing between foraging and other activities varied among cows, and the correct discrimination rate for the pooled data set was 92.4% for LDA and 85.6% for LR. Based on individual cow LDA, the time spent foraging averaged between 443 and 475 min·d-1. Our results indicated that LCEX can be used to identify the foraging activity of cattle. © 2013 The Society for Range Management.","activity monitor; cow; grazing behavior; grazing management; linear discriminant analysis; logistic regression","accelerometer; activity pattern; cattle; foraging behavior; grazing; grazing management; rangeland; threshold; Aichi; Chubu; Honshu; Japan; Nagoya; Animalia; Bos"
