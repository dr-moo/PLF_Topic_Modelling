A main objective of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) is to deliver a tool for active mangement of livestock to improve animal welfare and health and to make livestock farming more animal economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. The importance of well managed animal welfare is not limited to the ethical viewpoint but is also crucial to realise a more efficient process to produce animal products. When considering the metabolic energy balance in a homeothermic living organism, there are different components: basal metabolism, the thermal component, the physical component related to movement or delivering power, the production term (meat, milk, eggs) and finally the mental component. When applying the stress monitoring, developed for humans, on animals we see that we can monitor frustration of horses in real-time. This indicates that real-time animal welfare monitoring based upon physiological signals becomes a realistic pathway. © Precision Livestock Farming 2019 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2019.

"Gremmen B.","A moral Operating System of livestock farming",2017,"Pragmatism Today","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042559396&partnerID=40&md5=4aaa63f30416af2acc612f46e8eb27dd","Societal views about livestock production systems in Europe are changing dramatically in a negative direction. Based on the tradition of pragmatism in applied philosophy I develop a Moral Operating System of animal production systems in cooperating a plurality of ethical views. This moral operating system of animal production systems consists of two interactive, dynamic parts: an internal professional care ethics combined with an emergent ethics in life sciences enabling change by responsible innovation, and external ethical boundary conditions based on societal values and concerns in animal ethics and environmental ethics. I focus on the emergent ethics in life sciences because it most normative ethical theories have problems in dealing with the future. In moral reasoning about innovations in the making, the relevant moral facts and the appropriate principles are more or less still unknown, as also the relevant moral consequences. Only by doing ethics in life sciences in future projects will the moral dilemmas emerge in the trajectories of responsible innovation like molecular technologies in animal sciences and precision livestock farming. © 2017, Central European Pragmatist Forum.",,

This concept of ""Livestock Farming with Care"" is founded on care ethics with an integrated approach based on four principles: One Health (i.e. healthy and safe for animals and humans); Customized Care (i.e. from the individual animal's perspective and integrity); No Nuisance (i.e. from an environmental and societal perspective) and Credible Performance (i.e. from an economic and public prospect). It is acknowledged that the diversity in farming systems ranging from typical smallholder practices to high output production systems requires integrated and customized solutions based on this general concept. Emerging technologies as included in ""Precision Livestock Farming"" can be beneficial to the implementation. © 2013 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences.","Environment; Ethics; Livestock production; Local solutions; Precision livestock farming; Sustainability; Welfare","ethics; food; integrated approach; livestock farming; precision; smallholder; sustainability; Animalia"
