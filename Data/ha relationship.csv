The main tool proposed to improve the quality of HAR in dairy animals is training of stock-people by targeting their attitude and behaviour. Given that a good quality HAR may benefit the welfare of dairy animals and productivity, new technologies, by monitoring the handling routine on farm, may be more effective in promoting good practices. In particular, the implementation of new technologies may allow identification of specific inappropriate behaviours to be targeted at stockperson level, thus increasing the efficacy of training. However, an issue related to the introduction of new technologies in the farms, particularly in those that follow traditional farming practices, is the resistance to innovation which may be encountered.

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of studies on personality and attitude as risk factors for dairy cattle health, welfare, productivity, and farm management. Database searches captured 1,144 records, and 38 were finally included in the review. Thirty-three manuscripts assessed farmers' attitudes, 1 assessed their personalities, and 4 assessed both as risk factors. These potential risk factors were checked for relationships with more than 50 different outcome variables regarding farm management (17 manuscripts), animal health (13 manuscripts), animal productivity (11 manuscripts), and animal welfare (4 manuscripts). The approaches to assessing risk factors and processing and interpreting data varied greatly; thus, drawing conclusions regarding the effects of attitude and personality as risk factors is impeded because manuscripts are difficult to compare. Our findings highlight the need for harmonization of attitudes and personality assessments in future research. Furthermore, researchers should carefully consider which depth of detail to apply when planning and evaluating related research. Nevertheless, results highlight the importance of the effect of personality and attitude on outcomes. Farmers' personality and attitudes are associated with dairy cattle health, welfare, productivity, and management. In general, attitudes indicating higher degrees of technical knowledge, affection with problems, perceived responsibility, perception of control of a situation, a better human-animal relationship, or a positive evaluation of the benefits of management decisions tended to affect outcomes in a beneficial way. “Agreeableness” and “conscientiousness” were shown to promote better farm performance, whereas “neuroticism” had a negative effect. Therefore, further research on attitude and personality and their consideration by professionals and decision-makers within the dairy sector and politics is strongly recommended. This might provide the chance to better understand the needs of dairy farmers and therefore develop tailored advice and support strategies to improve both satisfactory and constructive cooperation. © 2019 American Dairy Science Association","attitude; dairy; personality; risk factor","agricultural land; agricultural worker; animal; animal welfare; attitude; bovine; dairying; decision making; health status; human; organization and management; perception; personality; physiology; procedures; productivity; psychology; risk factor; Animal Welfare; Animals; Attitude; Cattle; Dairying; Decision Making; Efficiency; Farmers; Farms; Health Status; Humans; Perception; Personality; Risk Factors"

It affects the nature and frequency of their daily tasks, specifically in relation to animals, and the data available about the animals. Consequently, it may affect the quality of the human-animal relationship and how farmers perceive their profession. To better understand these effects, a survey was carried out on 25 French farms raising three different species and equipped with different tools: milking robots and heat detectors for dairy cows, automatic feeders for sows, and electronic controllers and automatic weighing devices for poultry. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the farmers. The main results showed that there were diverse motivations behind the farmers’ decision to install new equipment: some sought better working conditions, others to improve their technical management, yet others were induced by value chain incentives. Most mentioned that their job had become more technical, and the majority were satisfied. Farmers’ interactions with their animals had changed and sometimes decreased, with less time spent in their presence or in direct contact. Digital data enabled a different view of animals, focusing on problematic individuals. Some farmers continued to observe their animals and used specific practices to facilitate work and reduce animal stress, while others delegated decisions and tasks entirely to their equipment. Nevertheless, some farmers noted limits regarding the place of new technologies on a farm, such as the risk of losing their own autonomy or their ability to observe animals and detect problems. © 2017 European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming.

Twelve commercial dairy farms in Northern Italy were selected and classified as ""good"" (n = 6) and ""poor"" (n = 6) HAR on the basis of reports from a technical advisor. Some variables were tested to measure the HAR: sneezing - the number of alert sounds; voluntary approach (VA) test - in a stationary situation, the latency to the first contact by goat and the% of goats that entered in contact with the test person and within a 1.5 m radius around her were recorded, both continuously and at scan sample intervals; avoidance distance (AD) test - the avoidance distance from a moving and approaching person and the% of tested goats, of contacts with the test person followed by withdrawal or of acceptances of gentle stroke were recorded. The feasibility of each test was evaluated based on costs, time consumption, safety and training requirement. Sneezes were rarely and random expressed, so they do not seem suitable to be included in a protocol. Both Principal Component Analysis and One-way ANOVA confirmed the predictive validity of most of the variables, which were able to discriminate between ""good"" and ""poor"" HAR farms. Latency to first contact resulted valid (P = 0.01) and a high feasibility was reported. The indicator was easy to be recorded and the VA test could be stopped immediately after the first contact, saving time. Variables from the AD test resulted valid (% tested goats: P = 0.006; AD mean: P = 0.016; % contacts: P = 0.006; % acceptance: P = 0.003), although they were more time consuming or required a more specific training compared to latency to first contact. The correlation among variables seemed to support also a convergent validity of the tests used. The investigation pinpointed promising behavioural tests to be included into on-farm welfare assessment protocols in dairy goats. Taking into account species, test results and feasibility considerations, we suggest the inclusion of latency to the first contact with the test person into on-farm welfare assessment protocols. However, these results should be further tested in a larger number of farms of different dimensions, to overcome the limitations of this study due to the small sample size and to check the effect of farm size. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Avoidance distance; Behavioural tests; Dairy goats; Human-Animal Relationship; Welfare assessment","animal welfare; assessment method; avoidance reaction; behavioral response; dairy farming; farm; feasibility study; goat; nature-society relations; qualitative analysis; Animalia; Capra hircus"

However, the adoption of agricultural technology is not homogenous, and diversity in integration leads to a diversity of outcomes and impacts. In this study, we examine the adoption of automated milking systems (AMS) in small and midsize dairy farms in the US Midwest, the Netherlands, and Denmark. In contrast to technological determinism, we find significant variation amongst adopters in the implementation of AMS and corresponding variation in outcomes. Adopters have significant discretion in determining the use of AMS, which leads to a diversity of possible outcomes for family and non-family labor, human–cow relationships, animal welfare, the environment, and financial resiliency. Adoption and implementation are shaped by both structural factors, such as debt load and labor market variation, and by farmers’ individual personality traits and values, such as a willingness (or not) to release control to technology. Rather than uniform adoption and impacts of technology, we highlight the importance of context, the co-constitution of technology and users, and the diversity of technology adoption and its associated impacts. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Animal studies; Animal welfare; Dairy farming; Environment; Labor; Technology","Animalia"

A good relationship between the stockman and his/her animals has been proven to have a positive effect on production and animal welfare parameters. In broiler chickens the quality of the human-animal relationship is related to fearfulness of the birds and can be measured by various tests. One such method, the Avoidance Distance Touch Test, is included in the Welfare Quality® welfare assessment protocol for broilers. Although physical contact between farmer and animal is rather limited in broiler flocks, studies show that the fear level of broilers varies as a result of the farmer's behaviour and routines and this has an effect on both productivity and welfare. In this pre-study, the human-animal relationship was assessed on one broiler farm in Italy using the Avoidance Distance Touch Test as the gold standard. Activity and distribution of the animals were recorded using video imaging technology. These data were gathered before, during and after a trained assessor walked through the broiler flock, mimicking in a standardised way the daily check that a farmer would perform. The hypothesis was that the time that it takes for the animals to return to their normal activity and distribution levels, after being disturbed by human presence, would reflect the fear of humans. Increased activity for a longer period would indicate high fear levels.","Activity; Broiler; Distribution; Human-animal relationship; Welfare","Agriculture; Imaging techniques; Thermodynamic properties; Assessment protocols; Automatic measurements; Broiler; Distribution; Distribution levels; Human-animal relationship; Physical contacts; Welfare; Animals"

Understanding the risk factors for injury and the causal relationships related to injuries and animal handling is important for developing prevention strategies and effective safety interventions. This study examined stress and handler attitude as possible risk factors for animal handling injuries in dairy farming, in particular when moving cows. Twelve dairy farms were visited on two occasions representing different stress levels: when cows were being moved to milking (low stress) and to hoof trimming (high stress). Behavioral observations of handlers and cows were performed, and questionnaires were completed on attitudes (risk acceptance, safety locus of control, and attitudes toward cows) and stress (perceived stress/energy level and job strain). The injury risks were found to be higher when moving cows to hoof trimming compared with moving cows to milking and gentle, moderately forceful, and forceful interactions were more frequently used. When moving cows to milking, observed risk situations were related only to the perceived energy level of the handler. When moving cows to hoof trimming, injury risks were correlated to job strain and time spent in the risk zone (defined as the area where the handler could be hit by the cow's head or hind legs). The time spent in the risk zone was positively correlated with job strain, age, and experience. Attitudes were not found to have significant impact on safety but were to some extent indirectly involved. These results suggest that the main focus in injury reduction work should be on reducing the time the handler spends in close proximity to animals during aversive procedures and on minimizing cow fear and stress by proper handling techniques and appropriate design of handling facilities. © 2015 ASABE.","Agriculture; Behavior; Dairy cows; Human-animal interaction; Job strain; Occupational injury","Animalia; animal; attitude; bovine; dairying; female; human; job satisfaction; male; mental stress; procedures; risk factor; safety; Sweden; Animals; Attitude; Cattle; Dairying; Female; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Male; Risk Factors; Safety; Stress, Psychological; Sweden"

Because robotic milking involves the replacement of 'conventional' twice-a-day milking managed by people with a system that supposedly allows cows the freedom to be milked automatically whenever they choose, some claim robotic milking has health and welfare benefits for cows, increases productivity, and has lifestyle advantages for dairy farmers. This paper examines how established ethical relations on dairy farms are unsettled by the intervention of a radically different technology such as AMS. The renegotiation of ethical relationships is thus an important dimension of how the actors involved are re-assembled around a new technology. The paper draws on in-depth research on UK dairy farms comparing those using conventional milking technologies with those using AMS. We explore the situated ethical relations that are negotiated in practice, focusing on the contingent and complex nature of human-animal-technology interactions. We show that ethical relations are situated and emergent, and that as the identities, roles, and subjectivities of humans and animals are unsettled through the intervention of a new technology, the ethical relations also shift. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Animal studies; Dairy farming; Robotic milking; Situated ethics; Technology; UK",

Rather than comparing bad and good technologies in the context of meat, I want instead to explore the dynamics of the human-animal relationships expressed within specific approaches. This method, I suggest, illustrates the technological aspects of the relationships, which reflect an orientation to the world (in the form of the animal body and the surrounding ecologies) that mediates human interaction with the environment. It also helps to show that the more we try to take responsibility for those bodies—in terms of knowledge, in terms of energy—the more we require the environment to reflect our conditions and the less tolerant we become of failure. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agriculture; Ethics; In vitro meat; Meat; Responsibility; Technology","agriculture; ethics; meat; technology; Animalia"

Housing of farm animals is a contentious issue for many, although the impact of the housing system may be overestimated by some. In contrast, the topic of stockmanship has received relatively little attention, even though research has shown that animal carers or stockpeople have a major impact on the welfare of their livestock. While welfare monitoring schemes are likely to improve animal welfare, the impact of such schemes will only be realised by recognising the limitations of stockpeople, monitoring 'stockmanship' and providing specific stockperson training to target key aspects of stockmanship. Appropriate strategies to recruit and train stockpeople in the livestock industries are integral to safeguarding the welfare of livestock. Monitoring the key job-related characteristics of the stockperson, attitudes to animals and to working with these animals, empathy, work motivation and technical knowledge and skills, provides the opportunity to detect deficits in stockmanship and the necessity for further targeted training. Due to the strong relationships between stockperson attitudes and behaviours and animal fear responses, as well as the relationships between attitudes and other job-related characteristics, we believe attitudes, together with empathy, work motivation and technical knowledge and skills, should be the principal focus of measuring stockmanship in on-farm welfare monitoring schemes. © 2009 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.","Animal welfare; Fear; Human-animal relations; Livestock; Stockmanship; Welfare monitoring","agricultural worker; animal care; animal housing; animal husbandry; animal welfare; attitude; conference paper; dairy cattle; empathy; farm animal; goat; human; job performance; job satisfaction; knowledge; livestock; motivation; nonhuman; object relation; poultry; scoring system; skill; swine; Animalia"

This study examines the assessment of stockmanship quality on commercial dairy farms and aims to develop useable protocols for on-farm assessment of stockmanship for inclusion in a quality-assurance scheme. In this study the behaviour of cows was used to assess the quality of stockmanship on fifteen commercial dairy farms, which varied in level of production and intensification. The behavioural reactions of cows to a novel human and the behaviour of the stockperson before, during and after milking were scored, and stockpersons completed a fifty-question psychometric attitude questionnaire, which was made up of seven subgroups of questions. Preliminary results indicated that stockpersons differ in the behaviour they use when handling cows. Stockpersons on zero-grazing farms appeared to use fewer positive tactile behaviours and more severe negative behaviour. The behavioural responses of cows in a novel human approach test differed between farm types. Cows on straw-court farms appeared to he more flighty and less confident in the presence of a novel human. Differences were observed in mean attitude scores for the seven subgroups of questions. Job type appears to have an effect on the extent of the stockperson's positive attitude toward cows, animals in general, job satisfaction and farm economics. The results indicate that there are differences in quality of stockmanship between farms and that the three methods chosen do identify these. They show that the human-animal relationship is a potential source of fear for cows in dairy production and therefore can be used to identify poor stockmanship.","Animal welfare; Dairy cow; Fear; Human-animal interaction; On-farm assessment; Stockmanship","analytic method; animal behavior; animal husbandry; animal welfare; article; attitude; controlled study; dairying; economics; fear; grazing; human; job performance; job satisfaction; milk production; nonhuman; organismal interaction; psychometry; quality control; questionnaire; Animalia"

While many of these interactions are routinely and, at times, habitually used by stockpeople, the frequent use of some of these routine behaviours can result in farm animals becoming highly fearful of humans. It is these high fear levels, through stress, that appear to limit animal productivity and welfare. This research has also shown that an important antecedent of stockperson behaviour is the attitude of the stockperson towards interacting with his or her farm animals. Intervention studies in the dairy and pig industries have shown the potential of cognitive-behavioural intervention techniques designed to specifically target those attitudes and behaviours of stockpeople that have a direct effect on animal fear, welfare and productivity. It is recommended that such cognitive-behavioural training programs for stockpeople are introduced in the livestock industries. Selection tools targeting the important human characteristics that affect work performance may also be valuable not only to select stockpeople but also to identify experienced and inexperienced stockpeople that require training. More extensive research is also required to identify the full range of stockperson interactions that have implication for farm animals. In addition to identifying the aversive elements of handling, the rewarding elements of human-animal interactions for animals should be identified and the opportunities to utilise these rewarding elements to alleviate some of the aversive interactions, that are at times necessary in livestock production, should be explored. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.
